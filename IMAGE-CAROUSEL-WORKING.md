## 🤖 About AI Generated Images:

### Current Status:
When you clicked "Generate AI Images" in the admin panel:
- ✅ Images were saved to Firebase Firestore
- ✅ Using Unsplash placeholder URLs
- ✅ Metadata stored with prompts
- ✅ Ready to be replaced with real AI images

### To See Firebase Images:
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Look for `divisionImages` collection
3. You should see entries for ESD division
4. Reload the division page to fetch them

### To Use Real Gemini AI:
The system is ready! It will use your API key to generate actual AI images when integrated with a proper image generation endpoint (Gemini currently provides text, not images directly, so you'd need to use DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, or similar for actual image generation).

## 🎊 What's Working NOW:

✅ **Immediate carousel** - 4 images per division
✅ **Auto-rotation** - Changes every 5 seconds
✅ **Manual control** - Click dots to navigate
✅ **Professional images** - High-quality visuals
✅ **All 10 divisions** - Each has unique images
✅ **Smooth transitions** - Ken Burns effect
✅ **Dark admin panel** - All text visible
✅ **Firebase integration** - Ready for custom uploads

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### Right Now:
1. ✅ Visit any division page
2. ✅ Watch the 4 images rotate
3. ✅ Click navigation dots
4. ✅ Enjoy the smooth transitions!

### Later (Optional):
1. Upload your own real project photos via admin
2. Replace Unsplash images with actual NARA photos
3. Set best image as primary
