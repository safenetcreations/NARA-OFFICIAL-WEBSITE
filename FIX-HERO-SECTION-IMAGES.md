# 🔧 FIX: Hero Section Not Fetching Gemini Images

## ✅ **What I've Fixed:**

### 1. **Storage Rules Updated** ✅
Added public read access for division images:
```javascript
// Division images (FULL PUBLIC READ ACCESS)
match /divisions/{divisionId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}
```
**Status: DEPLOYED!**

### 2. **Image Loading Priority Fixed** ✅
- Admin panel now loads from Firebase first
- Syncs to localStorage automatically
- Hero section checks both sources

## 🚀 **Quick Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Clear Everything**
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear Site Data (localStorage)
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **Step 2: Generate Fresh Images**
1. Go to: http://localhost:4028/admin/division-images
2. Select any division (e.g., Marine Biology)
3. Click "Enhance Prompts with Gemini"
4. Click "Generate with Gemini Native"
5. Wait for success message

### **Step 3: Verify Storage**
Check console for:
- "✅ Uploaded image X/4 to Firebase Storage"
- "💾 Images saved to Firebase Storage with permanent URLs!"
- "💾 Synced to localStorage for hero section"

### **Step 4: Test Hero Section**
1. Click "View in Hero Section" button
2. OR visit: http://localhost:4028/divisions/marine-biology
3. Images should load immediately!

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips:**

### **Check Console Logs:**
In hero section, you should see:
- "🔍 Checking localStorage for division: marine-biology"
- "💾 SUCCESS! Loaded 4 images from localStorage"
- "🎉 AI IMAGES CONNECTED TO HERO SECTION!"

OR if loading from Firebase:
- "🔍 Attempting to load images from Firebase: marine-biology"
- "✅ Loaded 4 images from Firebase"
- "🎉 FIREBASE IMAGES CONNECTED!"

### **If Images Don't Load:**

**1. Check Firebase Storage Console:**
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nara-web-73384/storage
- Navigate to: divisions/[division-id]/
- Verify images exist with public URLs

**2. Test Direct URL Access:**
- Copy any image URL from admin panel
- Paste in new browser tab
- Should load without authentication

**3. Check Network Tab:**
- Open DevTools → Network
- Filter by "Images"
- Reload hero section
- Look for failed image requests

## 📋 **Complete Fix Checklist:**

✅ Storage rules updated with public access for divisions/
✅ Admin panel syncs to localStorage on load
✅ Hero section checks localStorage first
✅ Falls back to Firebase if needed
✅ Saves Firebase images to localStorage

---

## 🎯 **Expected Flow:**

1. **Generate Images** → Upload to Firebase Storage
2. **Get URLs** → Save to localStorage
3. **Load Admin Panel** → Fetch from Firebase → Sync to localStorage
4. **Visit Hero Section** → Load from localStorage (instant!)
5. **If localStorage empty** → Fetch from Firebase → Save to localStorage

## 🆘 **Still Not Working?**

### **Manual CORS Fix (if needed):**
```bash
# Install gsutil
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

# Set CORS
gsutil cors set storage.cors.json gs://nara-web-73384.appspot.com
```

### **Force Refresh Everything:**
1. Clear all site data
2. Re-login to admin
3. Generate new images
4. Test again

### **Check Firebase Console:**
1. Storage rules are active
2. Images have public URLs
