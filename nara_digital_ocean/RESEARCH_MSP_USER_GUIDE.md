## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Partially. Map tiles require internet, but you can work with existing projects if loaded before going offline.

**Q: How many zones can I add?**
A: Technically unlimited, but performance may slow above 100 zones. Recommended: 20-50 zones per project.

**Q: Can I import existing GIS data?**
A: Currently only JSON import. GeoJSON import feature planned for next version.

**Q: Is my data backed up automatically?**
A: Projects save to your browser. For backup, regularly export to JSON and store on NARA servers.

**Q: Can multiple people edit the same project?**
A: Not simultaneously. One person exports, another imports. Real-time collaboration planned for future.

**Q: What coordinate system is used?**
A: WGS84 (EPSG:4326) - standard latitude/longitude.

**Q: Can I customize the templates?**
A: Currently fixed. Custom templates feature planned. Use "Custom Zone" for now.

**Q: Will my old projects work?**
A: Yes, backwards compatible with v1.0 projects.
