# Library Books Display Fix - Deployment Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Issue:** Books were not showing on the website despite 583 books in database
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Identified

The library catalogue containing 583 books was not displaying on the website due to:

1. **CORS Issue**: JSON file was hosted on Firebase Storage (different domain), causing browser cross-origin request blocking
2. **Routing Issue**: Firebase Hosting rewrite rules were redirecting ALL requests (including .json files) to index.html

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved JSON to Same Domain
- Copied `library_catalogue.json` (2MB, 583 books) from Firebase Storage to website's public folder
- Updated `.env` to point to same-domain URL:
  ```
  VITE_LIBRARY_CATALOGUE_URL=https://nara-web-73384.web.app/library_catalogue.json
  ```

### 2. Fixed Firebase Hosting Configuration
- Updated `firebase.json` rewrite rules to exclude file extensions from SPA routing
- Changed from redirecting `**` to excluding static assets:
  ```json
  "source": "!**/*.@(json|js|css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|webp|ico|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|map|txt|xml)"
  ```

### 3. Deployed Updated Website
- Rebuilt application with new configuration
- Deployed 269 files to Firebase Hosting (including the 2MB JSON)
- Verified JSON accessibility at: https://nara-web-73384.web.app/library_catalogue.json

## Verification Results

✅ **JSON File Accessible**: Successfully loaded 583 books from website domain
✅ **No CORS Errors**: Same-origin policy satisfied
✅ **Proper Schema**: All books include `material_type_code` field
✅ **API Functional**: Backend API serving book data at http://localhost:5000

## Library Statistics

### Current Database Status
- **Total Books**: 583 books processed and stored
- **Categories**: 26 material types (MAP, NEWS, RPAPER, EREP, BOBP, etc.)
- **Storage**: PDFs in Firebase Storage, metadata in PostgreSQL
- **QR Codes**: Generated for all books

### Category Distribution
- MAP: 44 books
- NEWS: 35 books
- RPAPER: 34 books
- EREP: 32 books
- BOBP: 30 books
- [Additional 21 categories with varying counts]

## Testing the Website

### Access the Library
1. Visit: https://nara-web-73384.web.app/library
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cache
3. Or use incognito/private browsing mode

### Expected Behavior
- Library page shows 26 category tiles
- Each tile displays category name and book count
- Clicking a category shows books in that category
- Search functionality works for book titles, authors, keywords

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/Users/nanthan/Desktop/nara digital/nara_digital_ocean/.env`
   - Changed catalogue URL from Firebase Storage to same domain

2. `/Users/nanthan/Desktop/nara digital/nara_digital_ocean/firebase.json`
   - Updated rewrite rules to exclude static files from SPA routing

3. `/Users/nanthan/Desktop/nara digital/nara_digital_ocean/public/library_catalogue.json`
   - Added 2MB JSON file with 583 book records

4. `/Users/nanthan/Desktop/nara digital/nara_digital_ocean/build/library_catalogue.json`
   - Copied JSON to build directory for deployment

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Rebuild application
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting:nara-web-73384
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. Test library page in browser (with hard refresh)
2. Verify all 26 categories display correctly
3. Test search functionality
4. Check book detail pages load properly

### Future Improvements
1. Consider enabling library agent workers to add more books
2. Implement API-based real-time loading instead of static JSON
3. Add pagination for better performance with large datasets
4. Configure CDN caching for the JSON file

## Background Agent Status

The library background agents were processing books successfully:
- Multiple workers running concurrently (5 workers)
- Successfully processed books from various sources (CORE, Archive.org)
- Automatic PDF download, validation, and Firebase Storage upload
- QR code generation for each book
- Database integration working correctly
