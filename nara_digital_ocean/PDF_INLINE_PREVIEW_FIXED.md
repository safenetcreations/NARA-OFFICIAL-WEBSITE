# ✅ PDF Inline Preview - FIXED!

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY - All Systems Operational

---

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### PDF Inline Preview Issue
**Problem:** English PDFs were not displaying properly inline on the original page, even after CORS was configured. The `<object>` tag approach was unreliable across browsers.

**Solution:** Implemented **Mozilla PDF.js viewer** for consistent, reliable inline PDF viewing.

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File Modified: `/src/pages/library-catalogue/ItemDetail.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
<object
  data={currentPdfUrl}
  type="application/pdf"
  className="w-full h-[800px]"
  title={`PDF Viewer - ${item.title}`}
>
  {/* Fallback content */}
</object>
```

**After:**
```javascript
<iframe
  src={`https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=${encodeURIComponent(currentPdfUrl)}`}
  className="w-full h-[800px] border-0"
  title={`PDF Viewer - ${item.title}`}
  allow="fullscreen"
/>
```

### Why This Works Better:
✅ **Cross-browser compatibility** - Works on all modern browsers
✅ **Consistent UI** - Same viewer experience for all users
✅ **Fullscreen support** - Users can expand PDF to full screen
✅ **No browser dependencies** - Doesn't rely on browser's native PDF viewer
✅ **Works with CORS** - Now that CORS is configured, PDF.js can load the files
