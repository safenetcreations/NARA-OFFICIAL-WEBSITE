    "abstract": "India is endowed with a continental shelf of 0.5 million km2 and an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of about 2 million km2. Almost half (39%) of the Indian population utilizes the marine fisheries resources. India ranked sixth worldwide in total fish production (4.95 million t) and second in inland fish production (2.24 million t) during 1995 - 96. Fish production expanded from 0.75 million t in 1950 - 51 to 4.95 million t in 1995 - 96, giving a significant increase at a cumulative growth rate of 4.2% per annum. Marine fish production increased from 0.53 million t in 1950 - 51 to 2.71 million t in 1995 - 96. The contribution of the fisheries sector to the total gross domestic product (GDP) improved from 0.75% in 1980 - 81 to 1.28% in 1994 - 95, with marine fisheries providing employment opportunities both in the production and post-harvest sectors. Subsidiary employment in fishing includes boat building and repair, net mending, repair of engines and supply of diesel, kerosene and other essential items. Women are mostly engaged in post-harvest operations like net mending, fish processing, packing and selling of fish and fish products. The contribution to foreign exchange earnings by the fishery sector substantially increased from Rs46 crores in 1960 - 61 to Rs4 697 (US$121*) in 1997 - 98. India exports about 55 types of marine products to different countries in Southwest Asia, Europe and USA. The total quantity of marine product exports rose from 97 200 t in 1987 - 88 to 307 337 t in 1994 - 95 giving an equivalent export value of Rs53 000 lakhs to Rs357 500 lakhs**. The marine fishing sector can be classified into: (a) non-motorized artisanal sector using country craft with traditional gear; (b) motorized sector; (c) mechanized sector using inboard engines of 50 to 120 HP; and (d) deep sea fishing with bigger boats (25 m and above) and engines of 120 HP and above. In 1996, India had a total fishing fleet of 238 125 units comprising 160 000 traditional craft, 31 726 motorized craft (converted from traditional) and 46 918 mechanized vessels operating different gear combinations. For artisanal fishing, the use of canoe and boat seine in Kerala provided the highest net income of Rs0.10 lakh with an annual catch of 51 t and an initial investment of Rs0.85 lakh. In motorized fishing, canoe and ring seine in Kerala offered a net income of Rs0.98 lakh with an annual catch of 220 t and an initial investment of Rs5.0 lakh. All major fishing units in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have higher profits not because of higher levels of fish catch but due to a better fish price. In the motorized sector, the increase in the price of fish over the years is greater than the increase in fuel expenditure. Small trawlers, purse seiners, dol-netters, gillnetters, pair trawlers and sona boats are the major types of mechanized fishing units operating in the inshore waters (up to 50 m depth). Trawlers and gillnetters are mostly operated along the Indian coasts whereas the fishing fleet mentioned above is confined to certain regions only. A small trawler (32Ã† - 36Ã†) has a net income of Rs0.90 lakh with an annual catch of 72 t and initial investment of Rs5.2 lakh in Karnataka. A purse seiner has a net earning of Rs3.14 lakh per year with an annual catch of 280 t and an average investment of Rs10 lakh. However the average value of fish caught in a purse seiner is Rs4.29 per kg set against the break-even cost of Rs3.16 per kg. To assess the economic sustainability of Indian marine fisheries in the period 1985 to 1998, the surplus production model or Schaefer Model was applied. Based on this, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 2 353 726 t with an estimated effort of 984 586 annual fishing hours (AFH). Using the Fox surplus production model, MSY was equal to 2 973 752 t with an effort of 6 126 232 AFH. Note that actual yield during that period was 2 441 043 t with an effort of 12 97 092 AFH. This is indicative of over-fishing in the Indian Sea and Bay of Bengal. A number of management strategies can be applied to reduce the fishing pressure on the coastal areas of India. These are: (a) a ban of certain fishing gear and restricted entry to over-exploited fishing grounds; (b) the promotion of alternative/subsidiary income and emphasizing the importance of mariculture/aquaculture; (c) effective implementation of small scale fishery development projects like infrastructure and service facilities; (d) coastal zone management including protection of marine habitats; and (e) information dissemination and education on the importance of fisheries resources.Fishery resources, Fishery surveys, Biomass, Population density, Shrimp fisheries, Catch/effort, Trawling, Mathematical models, Coastal fisheries, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Socioeconomic aspects, Artisanal fishing, Ecnonomic benefits, ISW, India,",

    "abstract": "Most of the world's fisheries and fishing communities are supported by coastal areas. Consequently, the well-being and future of the fishery sector depend on the health of the coastal ecosystem. Not surprisingly, therefore, concern about coastal degradation and its impact on the fishery sector has long been expressed, notably at the first-ever conference of fishworkers and their supporters in Rome in 1984. Discussions then emphasized how the coastal environment is affected by activities within the fisheries sector as well as by other activities pursued in inland, inshore and offshore areas.\n\n\n\nIt was in this context that the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers (ICSF) organized a workshop and symposium on Fisheries and Coastal Area Management in South Asia, in Madras, India, in 1996. To aid participants focus on the major coastal resources management issues, a background paper was prepared by ICSF. This paper explores efforts on coastal area management, more specifically in the South Asian region, and the extent to which the perspectives of actors in the fishery sector have been incorporated. It also deals with legislation of direct relevance to Integrated Coastal Area Management (ICAM)",

    "abstract": "Aquatic Commons is a digital repository established by the International Association of Aquatic\r\nand Marine Libraries and Information Centers (IAMSLIC) in 2007 to provide a solution for\r\nmember institutions that didn’t have an institutional repository. It is directed by the Aquatic\r\nCommons Board, and submissions are reviewed by an editorial team. Originally hosted by the\r\nFlorida Center for Library Automation (FCLA), the repository was moved to the International\r\nOceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) in 2011 when FCLA faced major\r\nbudgetary issues. Aquatic Commons has grown to more than 20,000 publications from over 90\r\ninstitutions in all areas of the aquatic sciences, including freshwater, fisheries, and\r\noceanography, yet support for the repository has not kept pace with developmental needs. To\r\nensure a sustainable future, the Aquatic Commons Board determined it was necessary to\r\nconduct an evaluation and created the Aquatic Commons Evaluation (ACE) team. The team\r\nidentified and compared four potential business models: 1a) maintain Aquatic Commons as a\r\nseparate repository but upgrade the EPrints software; 1b) maintain Aquatic Commons as a\r\nseparate repository but migrate to DSpace software; 2) migrate content to the existing IODE\r\nOceanDocs repository but retain Aquatic Commons identity by having a separate DSpace\r\ncommunity; and 3) partner with IODE and possibly the Aquatic Science and Fisheries Abstracts\r\n(ASFA) to create an entirely new repository with content merged from Aquatic Commons and\r\nOceanDocs. The team consulted with potential partners (e.g. ASFA and IODE) and ran a survey\r\nto elicit feedback from members, depositors, and other stakeholders about the models,\r\naddressing issues of thematic scope, branding, software, technical requirements, workflows,\r\nand training. At the 2019 conference, the team presented a recommendation based on the\r\nevaluation in order to initiate a roadmap for the Aquatic Commons",

A classification system of NIS, based on the magnitude of their environmental impacts, was recently proposed to assist management. Here, we consider the potential application of this classification scheme to the marine environment, and offer a complementary framework focussing on value sets in order to explicitly address marine management concerns. Since existing data on marine NIS impacts are scarce and successful marine removals are rare, we propose that management of marine NIS adopt a precautionary approach, which not only would emphasise preventing new incursions through pre-border and at-border controls but also should influence the categorisation of impacts. The study of marine invasion impacts requires urgent attention and significant investment, since we lack the luxury of waiting for the knowledge base to be acquired before the window of opportunity closes for feasible management",

After three decades of decline following a brief period of growth at the conclusion to World War lI, Hawaii's commercial fisheries began a decade of sustained development in the 1980's. At the same time, fisheries management issues became more significant as different segments of the fishery came into more direct competition. This paper provides new estimates of commercial landings for the 1977-90 period, and summarizes limited information on recreational and subsistence fisheries in the 1980's.

    "abstract": "Marine fisheries and fishing societies develop around the resources provided by a particular ecosystem. As they exploit these resources, fisheries transform the ecosystem, which pushes fishery and society to adapt in turn. This process is illustrated by fisheries, ecological and social data tracking dramatic changes on Newfoundland\\u27s Northern Peninsula and its adjacent marine ecosystem, the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. There a longstanding fishery for cod and other groundfish collapsed in the 1990s, and was replaced by fisheries targeting invertebrates. The new invertebrate fisheries have different socioeconomic characteristics than the former groundfish fisheries. The shift in target species reflects deep ecological changes that were underway at least a decade before official recognition of the crisis. Our analysis of biological data reveals that the main ecological changes occurred during “the glory years” of the 1980s, when Newfoundland\\u27s domestic fisheries were at their peak. Overfishing and interactions with adverse climatic conditions drove the changes. As the ecosystem transformed, human population declined due to outmigration, and social indicators show signs of distress. Accounts by outport residents paint a generational picture of social change",

    "abstract": "Ecosystems are complex and dynamic natural units that produce goods and services beyond those of benefit to fisheries. Because fisheries have a direct impact on the ecosystem, which is also impacted by other human activities, they need to be managed in an ecosystem context. The meaning of the terms 'ecosystem management', 'ecosystem based management', 'ecosystem approach to fisheries'(EAF), etc., are still not universally defined and progressively evolving. The justification of EAF is evident in the characteristics of an exploited ecosystem and the impacts resulting from fisheries and other activities. The rich set of international agreements of relevance to EAF contains a large number of principles and conceptual objectives. Both provide a fundamental guidance and a significant challenge for the implementation of EAF. The available international instruments also provide the institutional foundations for EAF. The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries is particularly important in this respect and contains provisions for practically all aspects of the approach. One major difficulty in defining EAF lies precisely in turning the available concepts and principles into operational objectives from which an EAF management plan would more easily be developed. The paper discusses these together with the types of action needed to achieve them. Experience in EAF implementation is still limited but some issues are already apparent, e.g. in added complexity, insufficient capacity, slow implementation, need for a pragmatic approach, etc. It is argued, in conclusion, that the future of EAF and fisheries depends on the way in which the two fundamental concepts of fisheries management and ecosystem management, and their respective stakeholders, will join efforts or collide",

The coast is Florida's economic engine. Florida's world-class beaches and coastal waters generate tens of billions of dollars from tourism and recreation andprovide habitat for numerous species of fish, birds, sea turtles, and other wildlife. Coastal marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass and oyster beds, and other habitats remove excess nutrients and pollutants, act as a buffer against major storms and flooding, and support the vast majority of Florida's marine fish and shellfish. Furthermore, the coralreefs off the Southeast coast and Florida Keys are home to thousands of marine species, support a thriving tourismindustry, and protect Florida's coasts from erosion and storm damage. These coastal and marine systems defineFlorida and frame the lives of Floridians. But these precious natural resources are at risk from destruction, misuse,and pollution.The Florida Coastal and Ocean Coalition created this second, updated Blueprint, Florida's Coastal and OceanFuture: An Updated Blueprint for Economic and Environmental Leadership, to inform state leaders and the publicof current issues affecting Florida's environment, economy, and citizens.

    "abstract": "Marine reserves, often referred to as no-take MPAs, are defined as areas within which human activities that can result in the removal or alteration of biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem are prohibited or greatly restricted (NRC 2001). Activities typically curtailed\n\nwithin a marine reserve are extraction of organisms (e.g., commercial and recreational fishing, kelp harvesting, commercial collecting), mariculture, and those activities that can alter oceanographic or geologic attributes of the habitat (e.g., mining, shore-based industrial-related\n\nintake and discharges of seawater and effluent). Usually, marine reserves are established to conserve biodiversity or enhance nearby fishery resources. Thus, goals and objectives of marine reserves can be inferred, even if they are not specifically articulated at the time of reserve\n\nformation.\n\n\n\nIn this report, we review information about the effectiveness of the three marine reserves in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, Point Lobos Ecological Reserve, Big Creek Ecological Reserve), and the one in the Channel Islands National\n\nMarine Sanctuary (the natural area on the north side of East Anacapa Island). Our efforts to objectively evaluate reserves in Central California relative to reserve theory were greatly hampered for four primary reasons; (1) few of the existing marine reserves were created with clearly articulated goals or objectives, (2) relatively few studies of the ecological consequences of existing reserves have been conducted, (3) no studies to date encompass the spatial and temporal scope needed to identify ecosystem-wide effects of reserve protection, and (4) there are\n\nalmost no studies that describe the social and economic consequences of existing reserves.\n\n\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we used several methods to evaluate the effectiveness of subtidal marine reserves in Central California. We first conducted a literature review to find out what research has been conducted in all marine reserves in Central California (Appendix 1). We then reviewed the scientific literature that relates to marine reserve theory to help define criteria to use as benchmarks for evaluation. A recent National Research Council (2001) report summarized expected reserve benefits and provided the criteria we used for evaluation of effectiveness. The next step was to identify the research projects in this region that collected information in a way that enabled us to evaluate reserve theory relative to marine reserves in\n\nCentral California. Chapters 1-4 in this report provide summaries of those research projects. Contained within these chapters are evaluations of reserve effectiveness for meeting specific objectives. As few studies exist that pertain to reserve theory in Central California, we reviewed\n\nstudies of marine reserves in other temperate and tropical ecosystems to determine if there were lessons to be learned from other parts of the world (Chapter 5). We also included a discussion of social and economic considerations germane to the public policy decision-making processes associated with marine reserves (Chapter 6). After reviewing all of these resources, we provided a summary of the ecological benefits that could be expected from existing reserves in Central California. The summary is presented in Part II of this report. (PDF contains 133 pages.",

    "abstract": "Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing refers to fishing activities that do not comply with national, regional, or international fisheries conservation or management legislation or measures . IUU fishing is complex and affects many stakeholders from the individual artisanal fisher in national waters, to fishing fleets in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and the High Seas, to fish processor and fisheries managers in developed and developing countries. Illegal fishing occurs in every ocean in the world, resulting in the loss of individual jobs and income, depletion of existing fish stocks, damage to the marine environment, and loss of state revenue . It affects activities both at sea and onshore, such as shipment, transportation, landing, importation and exportation, sale, and distribution of fish products . IUU fishing also has the potential to reduce the amount of fish available to subsistence fishers and communities who rely on fish as their staple diet. For example in Sierra Leone, fish provides approximately 65% of the protein source consumed by the under-nourished population. Thus people's livelihoods and food security may be seriously threatened by the possibility of losing access to this food source as result of IUU fishing",

    "abstract": "Marine reserves, areas permanently closed to all fishing, are frequently proposed as a tool for managing fisheries. Fishery benefits claimed for reserves include increases in spawning stock size, animal body size, and reproductive output of exploited species. Reserves are predicted to augment catches through export of offspring to fishing grounds, and spillover of juveniles and adults from reserves to fisheries. Protection of stocks and development of extended age structures of populations in reserves are argued to offer insurance against environmental variability and management failure. Models also suggest reserves will reduce year-to-year variability in catches, and offer greater simplicity of management and enforcement. Reserves are predicted to lead to habitat recovery from fishing disturbance which can also enhance benefits to fisheries. Extensive field research confirms many of these predictions. Reserves worldwide have led to increases in abundance, body size, biomass and reproductive output of exploited species. Such measures often increase many times over, sometimes by an order of magnitude or more. Population build up is usually rapid with effects detectable within 2-3 years of protection. Increases are often sustained over extended periods, particularly for longer-lived species and for measures of habitat recovery. Reserves have benefitted species from a wide taxonomic spectrum that covers most economically important taxa, including many species of fish, crustaceans, mollusks and echinoderms. Encouraged by these results, many countries and states have embarked upon initiatives to establish networks of marine reserves. However, reserves remain highly controversial among fishers and fishing industry bodies who argue that fishery benefits remain unproven. In the last three years there has been rapid growth in the number of cases where fisheries have been shown to benefit from reserves. In this report, we critically analyze this body of evidence, drawing upon studies of reserves and fishery closures. Fishery managers have long used fishery closures, areas temporarily closed to fishing for one or more species or to specific fishing gears. They are employed to help rebuild depleted stocks, reduce gear conflicts, protect vulnerable life stages of exploited species or protect sensitive habitats from damaging gears. Such areas can tell us much about the potential effects of marine reserves. Fishery benefits from reserves and fishery closures typically develop quickly, in most cases within five years of their creation. Perhaps the most persuasive evidence of fishery effects of reserves comes from changing fishing patterns. In most places where well-respected reserves or fishery closures exist, fishers tend to move their fishing activities closer to their boundaries. Fishing-the-line, as it is called, allows fishers to benefit from spillover of animals from reserves to fishing grounds. There are now well-documented cases of spillover from more than a dozen countries and including a wide range of species. It is more technically demanding to prove fishery enhancement through export of offspring on ocean currents. Existing reserves are generally small, making it hard to detect increased recruitment to fisheries at a regional scale. However, there are now several cases in which export of eggs and larvae have been confirmed, including dramatic enhancement of scallop fisheries in Georges Bank and clam fisheries in Fiji. Small reserves have worked well and repeatedly produce local benefits. However, regional fisheries enhancement will require more extensive networks of reserves. Some of the most convincing success stories come from places in which between 10 and 35% of fishing grounds have been protected. In several cases there is evidence that yields with reserves have risen to higher levels than prior to protection, despite a reduction in the area of fishing grounds. In other cases, smaller reserves have stabilized catches from intensively exploited fisheries or slowed existing rates of decline. We describe experiences that prove that success of marine reserves is not contingent on habitat type, geographical location, the kind of fishery involved, or the technological sophistication of management. Reserve benefits are not restricted to habitats like coral reefs, or to artisanal fisheries, as some critics claim. Fishery benefits have been demonstrated from reserves established in tropical, warm- and cold-temperate waters, and in many habitats, including coral reefs, rocky reefs, kelp forests, seagrass beds, mangroves, estuaries, soft sediments, continental shelves and deep sea. Reserves and fishery closures have worked well for a wide range of fisheries, spanning recreational fisheries, artisanal fisheries like those of coral reefs, through small-scale nearshore fisheries for species like lobsters, up to industrial-scale fisheries for animals like flatfish and scallops. They have worked across a similarly broad spectrum of management sophistication, from self-policing by committed fishers, through warden patrols to satellite monitoring of distant fishing activities. We now have strong evidence that with the support of local communities, marine reserves offer a highly effective management tool. However, reserves will only rarely be adequate as a stand-alone management approach, although we describe cases where they have worked in the absence of other measures. They will be most effective when implemented as part of a package of limits on fishing effort and protect exploited species and their habitats",

    "abstract": "More than 30 years after the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), discrimination on the basis of gender and its consequences for society is still struggling for mainstream attention especially in aquaculture and fisheries. FAO's 2010/11 flagship report on the State of Food and Agriculture highlighted the gender gap in agriculture and estimated that raising women's farm productivity by 20-30% could lift 100-150 million people out of poverty. Held as part of the 9th Asian Fisheries and Aquaculture Forum at Shanghai Ocean University from 21 to 23 April 2011, the 3rd Global Symposium on Gender in Aquaculture and Fisheries (GAF3) of the Asian Fisheries Society shone a light on the gender gap in the fish sector. This, the Society's fifth women/gender symposium, attracted a record number of papers and stimulated lively discussions. It was followed by a FAO Special Workshop on Future Directions for Gender in Aquaculture and Fisheries Action, Research and Development which will be reported on separately",

The goal was to better understand the nature of the problem and the potential impact of interventions in the fields of fisheries, aquaculture, poverty, and food security.The Foundation assembled a portfolio of learning grants that examined this problem from multiple perspectives in order to inform and assess the viability of and potential impact for future engagement on this topic. We supported four scoping studies that sought to identify populations dependent on marine fisheries, as well as review past experience with integrated approaches to fisheries management within a livelihoods and food security context. In partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, we also supported scoping work in four countries to assess opportunities for a coordinated strategy integrating national policy, local management, and innovative financing.We have learned a tremendous amount from the work our grantees have done, captured here by partner FSG in a summary and synthesis. We hope this information will contribute to the broader body of knowledge on this topic, as well as our own work",

It is the first of four in a global series of case studies on MPAs. An initial volume provides a synthesis and analysis of all the studies. The set of global MPA case studies was designed to close a deficit in information on the governance of MPAs and spatial management tools, within both fisheries management and biodiversity conservation contexts. The studies examine governance opportunities in and constraints on the use of spatial management measures at the national level. They were also designed to inform implementation of the FAO Technical Guidelines on marine protected areas (MPAs) and fisheries, which were developed to provide information and guidance on the use of MPAs in the context of fisheries",

    "abstract": "In 2004, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly approved a Regular Process to report on the environmental, economic and social aspects of the world's ocean. The Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects produced the first global integrated assessment of the marine environment in December 2016 (known as the first World Ocean Assessment). The second assessment, to be delivered in December 2020, will build on the baselines included in the first assessment, with a focus on establishing trends in the marine environment with relevance to global reporting needs such as those associated with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Central to the assessment process and its outputs are two components. First, is the utilization of ocean observation and monitoring outputs and research to temporally assess physical, chemical, biological, social, economic and cultural components of coastal and marine environments to establish their current state, impacts currently affecting coastal and marine environments, responses to those impacts and associated ongoing trends. Second, is the knowledge brokering of ocean observations and associated research to provide key information that can be utilized and applied to address management and policy needs at local, regional and global scales. Through identifying both knowledge gaps and capacity needs, the assessment process also provides direction to policy makers for the future development and deployment of sustained observation systems that are required for enhancing knowledge and supporting national aspirations associated with the sustainable development of coastal and marine ecosystems. Input from the ocean observation community, managers and policy makers is critical for ensuring that the vital information required for supporting the science policy interface objectives of the Regular Process is included in the assessment. This community white paper discusses developments in linking ocean observations and science with policy achieved as part of the assessment process, and those required for providing strategic linkages into the future.Agência financiadora - United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Seainfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

    "abstract": "The ocean is key to understanding societal threats including climate change, sea level rise, ocean warming, tsunamis, and earthquakes. Because the ocean is difficult and costly to monitor, we lack fundamental data needed to adequately model, understand, and address these threats. One solution is to integrate sensors into future undersea telecommunications cables. This is the mission of the SMART subsea cables initiative (Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications). SMART sensors would “piggyback” on the power and communications infrastructure of a million kilometers of undersea fiber optic cable and thousands of repeaters, creating the potential for seafloor-based global ocean observing at a modest incremental cost. Initial sensors would measure temperature, pressure, and seismic acceleration. The resulting data would address two critical scientific and societal issues: the long-term need for sustained climate-quality data from the under-sampled ocean (e.g., deep ocean temperature, sea level, and circulation), and the near-term need for improvements to global tsunami warning networks. A Joint Task Force (JTF) led by three UN agencies (ITU/WMO/UNESCO-IOC) is working to bring this initiative to fruition. This paper explores the ocean science and early warning improvements available from SMART cable data, and the societal, technological, and financial elements of realizing such a global network. Simulations show that deep ocean temperature and pressure measurements can improve estimates of ocean circulation and heat content, and cable-based pressure and seismic-acceleration sensors can improve tsunami warning times and earthquake parameters. The technology of integrating these sensors into fiber optic cables is discussed, addressing sea and land-based elements plus delivery of real-time open data products to end users. The science and business case for SMART cables is evaluated. SMART cables have been endorsed by major ocean science organizations, and JTF is working with cable suppliers and sponsors, multilateral development banks and end users to incorporate SMART capabilities into future cable projects. By investing now, we can build up a global ocean network of long-lived SMART cable sensors, creating a transformative addition to the Global Ocean Observing System",

As part of this review, NOAA’s National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP) has collaborated with NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) to conduct a biogeographic assessment of selected marine resources using geographic information system (GIS) technology. This report complements the analyses conducted for this effort by providing an overview of the physical and biological characteristics of the region. Key ecosystems and species occurring in estuarine and marine waters are highlighted and linkages between them discussed. In addition, this report describes biogeographic processes operating to affect species’ distributional patterns. The biogeographic analyses build upon this background to further understanding of the biogeography of this region. (PDF contaons 172 pages",

    "abstract": "Sea age, size, and condition of adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are prime determinants of individual, and hence population, productivity. To elucidate potential mechanisms, 151 000 records of salmon returning to six Scottish coastal sites over 44 years were analysedfor length, weight, and condition, by site, sex, sea age, and river age. After correcting for capture effort biases, all sites showed seasonal increases in length and weight for both 1 sea winter (1SW) and 2SW fish. However, whereas condition increased slightly with season for 2SW, it decreased notably for 1SW. Sites showed common decadal trends in length, weight, and condition. Within years, length and weight residuals from trends were coherent across sites, but residuals from condition trends were not. Rates of seasonal condition change also showed decadal trends, dramatically different between sea ages, but common across sites within sea-age groups. Longer salmon were disproportionately heavy in all seasons. 1SW condition was markedly lower in 2006. Detrended correlations withoceanic environmental variables were generally not significant, and always weak. A published correlation between the condition of 1SW salmon caught at a single site and sea surface temperatures in the Northeast Atlantic could not be substantiated for any of the six fisheries over the wider time-scales examined",

    "abstract": "The Sargasso Sea is a fundamentally important part of the world's ocean, located within the North Atlantic sub-tropical gyre with its boundaries defined by the surrounding currents. It is the only sea without land boundaries with water depths ranging from the surface coral reefs of Bermuda to abyssal plains at 4500 m. The Sargasso Sea's importance derives from the interdependent mix of its physical structure and properties, its ecosystems, its role in global scale ocean and earth system processes, its socio-economic and cultural values, and its role in global scientific research. Despite this, the Sargasso Sea is threatened by a range of human activities that either directly adversely impact it or have the potential to do so. Being Open Ocean, the Sargasso Sea is part of the High Seas, the area of ocean that covers nearly 50%of the earth's surface but which is beyond the jurisdiction and responsibility of any national government, and as such it enjoys little protection. To promote the importance of the Sargasso Sea, the Sargasso Sea Alliance was created under the leadership of the Government of Bermudian 2010. This report provides a summary of the scientific and other supporting evidence for the importance of the Sargasso Sea and is intended to develop international recognition of this; to start the process of establishing appropriate management and precautionary regimes within existing agreements; and to stimulate a wider debate on appropriate management and protection for the High Seas. Nine reasons why the Sargasso Sea is important are described and discussed. It is a place of legend with a rich history of great importance to Bermuda; it has an iconic ecosystem based upon floating Sargassum, the world's only holopelagic seaweed, hosting a rich and diverse community including ten endemic species; it provides essential habitat for nurturing a wide diversity of species many of which are endangered or threatened; it is the only breeding location for the threatened European and American eels; it lies within a large ocean gyre which concentrates pollutants and which has a variety of oceanographic processes that impact its productivity and species diversity; it plays a disproportionately large role in global ocean processes of carbon sequestration; it is of major importance for global scientific research and monitoring and is home to the world's longest ocean time series of measurements; it has significant values to local and world-wide economies; and it is threatened by activities including over-fishing, pollution, shipping, and Sargassum harvesting. Apart from over-fishing many of the threats are potential, with few direct causal relationships between specific activities and adverse impacts. But there is accumulative evidence that the Sargasso Sea is being adversely impacted by human activities, and with the possibility of new uses for Sargassum in the future, the lack of direct scientific evidence does not preclude international action through the established precautionary approach. The opportunity to recognize the importance of the Sargasso Sea and to develop and implement procedures to protect this iconic region and the wider High Seas should be taken before it is too late",

    "abstract": "The complexity of the political and ecological situation in the Baltic Sea area calls for strong international cooperation in order to achieve economically and socially sustainable, environmentally safe fisheries. Management needs to be flexible to allow for direct reactions and adjustments in case of any natural or anthropogenic adverse impacts. At the same time, a minimum of income stability from the transboundary, hence internationally shared, fish resources in the Baltic Sea should be guaranteed to local fishing communities. The article under consideration analyses the past, present and future situation of fisheries management in the Baltic Sea. Emphasis is put on the functioning of the European Community’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In order to achieve sustainable fisheries, the conservation of stocks is of prime importance. The new CFP as of December 2002 provides for this objective by introducing long-term management and recovery plans, emphasising the necessity of a healthy marine ecosystem, and allowing for flexible management tools. It is therefore concluded that Baltic Sea fisheries management is likely to benefit, if the opportunities for improvement, which the new CFP regulation has enshrined, are realised.fisheries",

    "abstract": "In April 1990, the Steller sea lion, Eumetopias jubatus, was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act by emergency action. Competitive interactions with the billion-dollar Alaska commercial groundfish fisheries have been suggested as one of the possible contributing factors to the Steller sea lion population decline. Since the listing, fisheries managers have attempted to address the potential impacts of the groundfish fisheries on Steller sea lion recovery. In this paper, we review pertinent Federal legislation, biological information on the Steller sea lion decline, changes in the Alaska trawl fishery for walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, since the late 1970's, andpossible interactions between fisheries and sea lions. Using three cases, we illustrate how the listing of Steller sea lions has affected Alaska groundfish fisheries through: I) actions taken at the time of listing designed to limit the potential for directhuman-related sea lion mortality, 2) actions addressing spatial and temporal separation of fisheries from sea lions, and 3) introduction of risk-adverse stock assessment methodologies and Steller sea lion conservation considerations directly in the annual quota-setting process. This discussion shows some of the ways that North Pacific groundfish resource managers have begun to explicitly consider the conservation ofmarine mammal and other nontarget species",

    "abstract": "The fisheries sector of Vietnam plays an important role in the social and economic development of the country. The sector contributes about 3% of the GDP and fish contributes about 40% of animal protein consumption in the country. In 1999, total fisheries production amounted to 1.8 million t. Of this, 1.2 million t was derived from marine capture fisheries and 0.6 million t from aquaculture. Fish exports were valued at US$971.12 million in the same year. VietnamÃ†s marine fisheries and coastal aquaculture have further potential for development. However, overfishing in coastal areas, degradation of the marine environment and conflicts between small-scale and large scale fishers must be resolved to realize the sectorÃ†s potential. This report presents the status of coastal fisheries resources, reviews government fisheries policies and suggested management measures. Based on the recommendations from a multisectoral consultative workshop conducted among the key experts on fisheries and resource management in Vietnam, the following fisheries management objectives were suggested for sustainable development of coastal fisheries in Vietnam: (1) optimization of productivity and efficiency of the fisheries exploitation regime; (2) ensuring that the benefits of production are distributed equitably; (3) ensuring that the productivity generated results in minimum damage to the resource base and the supporting natural environment; and (4) upgrading and strengthening the related institutions. Indicative action programs for improved management are also presented.Fishery resources, Catch/effort, Population characteristics, Coastal fisheries, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, Fishery policy, Legislation, Fishery management, Demersal fisheries, Pelagic fisheries, Cephalopod fisheries, Socioeconomic aspects, Surveys, Marketing, Fishery organizations, Fishing gear, Cephalopod fisheries, Trade, ISEW, Vietnam,",

    "abstract": "Aquaculture production in Nigeria has increased tremendously in recent times; along with this increase is the rise in the level of waste outputs from aquaculture practices.  The discharge of waste from aquaculture operations on continuous basis leads to eutrophication and destruction of natural ecosystem in receiving water body.  Controlled wastes production strategies is necessary to maintain sustainable aquaculture growth into the future, as long-term sustainability of fish culture systems depends on their ability to reduce their waste outputs.  The release of solid wastes is mainly a function of the digestibility of various dietary components while the release of dissolved wastes is mainly a function of the metabolism of nutrients by the fish.  This paper critically reviews the impacts of aquaculture wastes on the environment and the strategies to mitigate the effect of these impacts.  Future trends and research needs on aquaculture induced effluents are outlined.  As the amount of nutrient discharge is typically site and operation specific, effective farm management has been identified as the most important factor to avoid effluent pollution",

    "abstract": "The paper appraises fisheries development in Nigeria with specific reference to Cross River State and the problems militating against increased fish production. The potential for developing the industry to supplement the low level of animal protein consumption in Nigeria is discussed as well as the import of a vibrant fishery industry to contribute to the employment and international trade. The need to legislate on fisheries activities while enforcing the existing laws for sustainable exploitation of the fisheries resources is elaborated. Similarly, the need to maximize the proceeds from Nigeria's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) by protecting the operations of this economic sector and other unauthorized fishing practices is elucidated. In view of the present situation where most of the country's water bodies have been over-fished, more attention and emphasis should be placed on aquaculture development. The paper also proffers recommendations to boost fish production in capture and culture fisherie",

Then we calculated which topics are core and prominence levels based on method of Sujit Battarcharja and Moh’d Taiyab Rashid Khan. In-depth interviews were also carried out to explore problems on Indonesian marine research besides getting confirmation, comments and ideas related to the result of bibliometrics analysis. The informants were experts in marine science from a research institution, a government ministry, and a university. The results of this study could be employed to evaluate the research collaboration program between LIPI and Japanese institutions especially under JSPS program in the future",

    "abstract": "The development of Japan's community-based fishery management system is described. Over the past 250 years, three fishery laws were in effect. These fishery laws commonly adopted a fishing rights system as a tool for coastal fisheries management. During the feudal era until 1867, the fishing right system was used mainly to collect a fishery tax. The fishing right system established by the Old Fishery Law (1901-1947) helped to reduce conflicts between fishermen exploiting the same resources with different gears. The Current Fishery Law, enacted in 1949, has led to \"Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries\" by limiting its coverage to sedentary resources and non-mobile gear. At the same time, the Current Fishery Law created a system to establish coastal fishery management plans through fishing rights and licenses. These innovations have motivated fishermen to create the community-based coastal fisheries management system. Since the inception of the Current Fishery Law in 1949, the number of fishery management organizations created increased annually to a total of 1524 in 1993.fishery law, fishing rights, fishing license, fishery cooperative association, community-based fisheries management, fisheries management organization, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Development, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,",

    "abstract": "The marine fisheries sector in Malaysia contributes significantly to the national economy in terms of income, foreign exchange and employment. In 1999, marine fisheries contributed 1.245 million t (90% of total fish production) valued at US$1.18 billion. The total value accounted for about 1.53% of national GDP and 11.31% of agricultural GDP. The export of fish and fishery products amounted to about US$210 million. The sector provided employment to about 80 000 fishers. Fisheries management is currently guided by the Third National Agricultural Policy (NAP3 1998 - 2010). The NAP3 aims to maintain the coastal fisheries production while increasing the production from deep-sea fisheries within MalaysiaÃ†s Exclusive Economic Zone and the high-seas. Fisheries management of fisheries is centralized and is the primary responsibility of the Department of Fisheries. The key challenges identified for Malaysian fisheries are overfishing, excess fishing capacity and ensuring the well-being of coastal fishing communities. These are issues across the whole of Malaysia. The West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia produces 44% (1997) of total marine landings and 86% of this came from commercial (large scale) vessels. The landings in 1997 exceeded the estimated MSY and the biomass of demersal species in the region has been severely reduced. A national consultative workshop identified the primary aims for this region to improve production and efficiency of the fisheries, equitable distribution of the benefits, resources sustainability and the viability of the fishing communities. The workshop also identified key interventions needed. In terms of production and efficiency, overfishing and overcapacity must be addressed, including the illegal fishing. In terms of achieving greater equity, the workshop suggests greater involvement of small scale fishers in marketing of the catch. For resource sustainability, the serious decline in biomass must be addressed but there are also significant cross-sectoral issues. To achieve viable fishing communities, the workshop suggests the need for greater involvement and potentially a co-management approach for fisheries management.Fishery resources, Catch/effort, Population characteristics, Coastal fisheries, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, Fishery policy, Legislation, Fishery management, Demersal fisheries, Pelagic fisheries, Socioeconomic aspects, Surveys, Marketing, Fishery organizations, Fishing gear, Cephalopod fisheries, ISEW, Malaysia,",

    "abstract": "This report provides a snapshot of near shore fisheries law and governance in Fiji as of January 2015. It includes an objective, detailed description and analysis of both the modern legal system based on English common law and the traditional iTaukei system of law and governance, and how they apply to near shore fisheries throughout the country. The report also seeks to clarify the relative balance – and the potential gaps, redundancies, and limitations – between these two governing systems by describing how they are or can be used for day-to-day, practical management of near shore fisheries and coastal resources. Ultimately, this report is intended to shed light on a governance system that, on the one hand, has done well over the past 10-15 years to facilitate a dramatic increase in efforts to improve near shore fisheries management in Fiji; but on the other hand, probably requires a thoughtful update sometime in the next several years, with input from all stakeholders, if it is going to promote durable changes in the way near shore fisheries resources are managed for the benefit of both human welfare and environmental integrity",

    "abstract": "The aquaculture industry is fast expanding around the globe and causing major environmental and social disruptions. The volume is about getting a 'good governance' grip on this important industry.              The book highlights the numerous law and policy issues that must be addressed in the search for effective regulation of aquaculture. Those issues include among others: the equitable and fair assignment of property rights; the design of effective dispute resolution mechanisms; clarification of what maritime laws apply to aquaculture; adoption of a proper taxation system for aquaculture; resolution of aboriginal offshore title and rights claims; recognition of international trade law restrictions such as labeling limitations and food safety requirements; and determination of whether genetically modified fish should be allowed and if so under what controls.              This book will appeal to a broad range of audiences: undergraduate and postgraduate students, academic researchers, policy makers, NGOs, practicing lawyers and industry representatives",

The 2009 Act presented an opportunity to harmonise marine management by simplifying the complexity in England through a radical restructuring of marine governance; however this is apparently not the case with many overlapping responsibilities still existing. This paper provides an overview of the 2009 Act, discussing some of the significant changes like the creation of the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), examines the current structure of marine management in England following its enactment and highlights the continued overlaps in jurisdiction, responsibilities and complexity of the government agencies with a marine remit. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd",

Following population growth, the oceans are expected to make a significant contribution to food security for over 9 billion people by 2050.1 Aside from nutrition, the seas deliver many other ecosystem benefits, including climate stabilization, molecules used in medicine and engineering, the protection of coastlines through ecosystems, such as corals and mangrove, and they act as a sink for 90 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, its vital importance is often overlooked. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change notes only ‘the importance of ensuring the integrity..",

The project was implemented between 1998 and 2001. The main achievements of this partnership were: (a) Development of a database called “Fisheries Resource Information System and Tools” (FiRST), which contains trawl research survey data and socioeconomic information for selected fisheries, and facilitates its analysis; (b) Evaluation of the extent of resource decline and over-fishing, both biological and economic, in the region; (c) Identification of the measures needed to manage coastal fisheries in the participating countries, resulting in draft strategies and action plans; and (d) Strengthening of national capacity in coastal fisheries assessment, planning and management",

    "abstract": "Fisheries are an important source of protein and employment for Sri LankaÃ†s population. The declaration of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1976 gave the country a water area larger than its land area. The coastal fisheries resources consist of small and large pelagic fish, demersal and coral reef fish, invertebrates, shrimps and crabs. The small pelagic fish contribute 70% of the catch from coastal waters with an estimated annual production of 152 752 t in 1997. Some of the fisheries resources in Sri Lanka have been overexploited, although the situation varies across resource types and regions. A major reason for this has been the lack of proper management, particularly at the time of the introduction of motorized craft and synthetic nets which virtually revolutionized the fishing industry. Valuable habitat such as coral reef, mangrove, sea grass and marshland are also extremely susceptible to degradation. Destruction of these critical habitats could lead to reduced coastal fish stocks. This paper provides a broad review of the national fisheries situation in Sri Lanka, presenting the environment status, coastal capture fisheries situation and fisheries management issues and opportunities. The main objectives for improving the fisheries management in Sri Lanka, as suggested by a national consultative workshop are: (1) promotion of sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources; (2) improvement of habitat protection; (3) maximization of the benefits from the fishery resources; (4) promotion of equitable distribution of the benefits; (5) maximization of the acceptability of interventions; and (6) maximization of the efficiency of institutional/legal system.Fishery resources, Catch/effort, Population characteristics, Coastal fisheries, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, Fishery policy, Legislation, Fishery management, Demersal fisheries, Pelagic fisheries, Cephalopod fisheries, Socioeconomic aspects, Surveys, Marketing, Fishery organizations, Fishing gear, Crustacean fisheries, Trade, ISW, Sri Lanka,",

However, in recent years, the wild population of sea cucumbers is on the decline due to the increasing market demand and the consequent over-harvest of resources. The global scenario of stock decline was witnessed in Indian waters too in the early 1980s, and as a regulatory measure, the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEF & CC), Government of India implemented a size regulation on the export of ‘beche-de-mer’ in 1982. As this regulation was not very effective, the Government imposed a blanket ban in the year 2001, and listed all species of holothurians under the Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, thereby putting an end to the sea cucumber fishery and trade from the country. In India, the fishery of sea cucumbers was restricted mainly to the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay, along the south-east coast and the moratorium imposed by the Government affected scores of coastal communities whose livelihood was dependent on the collection, processing and trade of sea cucumbers",

They have\n\ncontinued to increase up to 2005; the catch that year was 1201465\n\nt, forming about 26% of the world catch. Since 2006 onwards\n\nthere has been a decline in the volume of catches and in 2008\n\nthe catch was only 913625 t. The Principal species caught in the\n\nIndian Ocean are skipjack and yellowfin. Western Indian Ocean\n\ncontributed 78.2% and eastern Indian Ocean 21.8% of the total\n\ntuna production from the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean stock\n\nis currently overfished and IOTC has made some recommendations\n\nfor management regulations aimed at sustaining the tuna stock.\n\nFishing operations can cause ecological impacts of different types:\n\nby catches, damage of the habitat, mortalities caused by lost or\n\ndiscarded gear, pollution, generation of marine debris, etc. Periodic\n\nreassessment of the tuna potential is also required with adequate\n\ninputs from exploratory surveys as well as commercial landings\n\nand this may prevent any unsustainable trends in the development\n\nof the tuna fishing industry in the Indian Ocean",

The value of riverine fisheries has been considered in the following two ways: firstly, through a compilation and summary of the results of existing studies on this topic; secondly, by estimating the direct use value of riverine and floodplain fishing by country using quantities and freshwater fish prices derived from various sources. Furthermore, a review of the characteristics of the fisheries is presented. These fisheries have been shown to be valuable (i.e., economically or socially important) in at least two specific ways: as a generator of commercially marketable output, and as a source of income and employment in relatively impoverished communities",

It presents a review of what are seen as 'good practices' globally in policy and governance of small-scale fisheries, with a particular focus on addressing rights-based issues, viewed broadly as incorporating fishery rights, other rights to natural resources, and rights and entitlements in relation to human, social and economic rights. It draws extensively on the 1995 Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and related technical guidelines, particularly those concerning small-scale fisheries and their roles in poverty alleviation and food security, and the human dimensions of the ecosystem approach to fisheries. The paper is also strongly informed by the papers prepared for and outcomes of the 2008 Global Conference on \"Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries: Bringing together responsible fisheries and social development\" and the relevant rights-oriented components of the 'Bangkok Statement' produced by the Civil Society Preparatory Workshop for the Global Conference. It also draws upon a set of research documents in the international literature focusing on small-scale fisheries and related policy issues [e.g., Allison et al. (2010), Charles (2009, 2011), McConney and Charles (2009); Kurien (2000, 2007)]",

    "abstract": "This is the report of the APFIC regional workshop on \"Mainstreaming fisheries co-management\" held in Siem Reap, Cambodia from August 9-12, 2005 . The goal of the workshop was to provide a forum to learn from past experience and to promote devolved management of fisheries. Participants at the workshop had the opportunity to be exposed to a range of coastal and inland fisheries co-management interventions and the elaboration of approaches needed to make fisheries co-management a \"mainstream\" activity in developing countries. The objective of the workshop was to develop summary conclusions on the status of co-management in the region and provide some concrete recommendations for action towards mainstreaming fishery co-management in the Asia-Pacific region. The report contains the action plan and recommendations of the workshop. Many agencies (both governmental and non-governmental) are striving to improve the livelihoods of poor people that are dependent on aquatic resources by including these stakeholders in the planning and implementation of fisheries management. Many states have adopted decentralization as the way to implement future fisheries management, especially in developing countries, which often involves a partnership between government and the local communities, i.e. a co-management approach. The challenge is to find a way for co-management to become a mainstream practice of both government and non-government organizations and communities",

    "abstract": "This is the working paper regarding the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme (SFLP). Diversification is a process by which households engage in multiple income generating activities. It is widely seen in the academic literature and international development arena as a strategy for spreading risk and reducing vulnerability. The formulation of policies promoting diversification is thus encouraged at national levels to alleviate poverty. However, such policies involve delicate choices and trade-offs between government objectives of development, e.g. intensification of agriculture and increase in agricultural outputs to satisfy export markets, versus increased household well-being and resilience to adversity through the promotion of small-scale, household-based, activities. In the context of fisheries, diversification is promoted as a means for reducing dependence on the resource, making restrictive management easier and less controversial for those affected by such measures. This often interprets diversification as job-substitution (stop fishing, do something else) rather than adding other activities to an income-portfolio. With the tendency for increasing pressure on fishery resources, it becomes ever more necessary to address in a coherent way diversification and its links with both poverty reduction and responsible fisheries. Implications of the development of alternative or complementary activities alongside a main, resource-dependent activity such as fishing, may echo those experienced by sectors such as agriculture and pastoralism. However, many characteristics of the fishing activity and of those who engage in it are particular to the sector. General poverty alleviation policies and fisheries management schemes have been found to lack the necessary differentiation and to fail to cater for the specific needs of fishing communities (Smith et al. 2005). The lack of attention -- or misplaced attention through maladapted policies -- that the sector and the communities it supports have received so far can be traced to a number of misconceptions stemming from \"the old paradigm on poverty in small-scale fisheries\" (Béné, 2003, p950). These assumptions include that (after Béné 2003, Allison and Ellis 2001): -- Fishing is an ingrained activity in fishing communities and fishermen will not leave fishing for cultural reasons. -- Fishermen are specialised and carry out fishing on a professional basis only. -- Fishing is a last resort activity and fishermen are unable to diversify into other income-generating activities. -- Fisheries development and development of fishing communities is not possible without increasing fishing effort. -- Livelihood diversification in fishing communities cannot go hand in hand with a sustainable natural resources management that encompasses both sustainable fisheries management and poverty alleviation. It is the aim of this paper to challenge these assumptions. Because of its linkages with resource management, looking at diversification in fishing communities involves re-exploring the issue from a different perspective than its current interpretation and most widely-encountered application to agricultural (land-based)-livelihoods. Despite the potential broad remit of this task, the objective here is to remain focused on the necessity to dispel misconceptions and show the need to formulate policies that support the engagement of fisherfolk and their families in multiple activities. By doing so, the paper shall also provide a compilation and review of available information related to diversification in fishing communities and point out the complexity of the issue of diversification in these communities. The geographical scope of the paper is global, guided by the availability of case study material, though reference to the West African experiences of the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme (SFLP) is made wherever possible. Unless expressed otherwise, the terms 'fisheries' or 'fishers' make implicit reference to artisanal fisheries and the small-scale operations and modus operandi of those relying on them",

    "abstract": "The focus of this paper is on the governance of small-scale or municipal fisheries in the Philippines in light of the critical role they play in the livelihoods of coastal communities and in the nation as a whole. The information and insights presented in this lessons learned brief derive from the project entitled Strengthening Governance and Sustainability of Small-Scale Fisheries Management in the Philippines: An Ecosystem Approach. The project was funded principally by the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR), and implemented from 2008 to 2011 by WorldFish in collaboration with the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and selected partners. The underlying project's goal was to 'strengthen governance and sustainability of small-scale fisheries management in the Philippines.' There were a variety of objectives spread across two project phases but the primary objectives relevant to this brief include: (1) identifying issues at project sites and assessing potential for an ecosystem based approach to fisheries management, and (2) assessing current fisheries management practices at different levels of governance and identifying best practices. The purposes of this paper are twofold. First, it aims to provide brief highlights of the project findings; second, it aims to present the lessons learned in project implementation covering substantive sectoral concerns as well as methodological issues. It wraps up with some strategic directions that need to be undertaken to reverse the deteriorating conditions of small-scale fisheries (SSF) while at the same time promoting their sustainable development",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the coastal fishery resources of Bangladesh emphasizing the coastal environment, capture fisheries and management issues relative to the sector. BangladeshÃ†s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers an area of about 166 000 km2. This area has abundant natural resources such as fish, shrimps, crabs and other marine products. Shrimp and fish trawling is the most important economic activity in this area. The fishery sector makes a significant contribution to the national economy in terms of foreign exchange, income generation and employment. It is very important in nutrition, especially in providing animal protein. In 1997 - 99, the marine fisheries sector contributed 22% of the total fishery production of 1 373 000 t. However, the resources are being destroyed in many ways. The fisheries resources have declined and fishers are getting poorer. The decline is partly due to estuarine set bag net, push net, and beach seine fishing, which result in recruitment over-fishing. A multiplicity of factors adversely affect the coastal fishery resources of Bangladesh. Various laws, ordinances and acts have been formulated to manage the fisheries resources and to protect the coastal zone environment. Most of the laws have been amended to meet current needs. However, marine fisheries are not being well-managed because the laws are not properly implemented, due to a shortage of man power, lack of infrastructure and funds. Moreover, there are legislative and communication gaps between the law-enforcing agencies. In addition to sectoral issues, a number of cross-sectoral issues such as pollution and habitat destruction impact the coastal zone and the long-term sustainability of coastal fishery resources. The main objectives of coastal fisheries management in Bangladesh should include the following: (1) rational utilization of resources; (2) protection/conservation of the environment or habitat; (3) maximization of the benefits from utilization of the resources within sustainable limits; (4) minimization of conflicts among users; (5) promotion of equity in sharing benefits from utilization of the resources; (6) reduction of poverty among small scale fishers; and (7) promotion of alternative livelihood opportunities for fishers.Fishery resources, Catch/effort, Population characteristics, Coastal fisheries, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, Fishery policy, Legislation, Fishery management, Flood plains, Demersal fisheries, Pelagic fisheries, Socioeconomic aspects, Surveys, Marketing, Fish storage, ISW, Bangladesh,",

    "abstract": "Fisheries are an important source of animal protein for most of ThailandÃ†s population, particularly in provinces on or near the coast. Between 1978 and 1997 the per capita consumption of fish averaged 24 kgâ•–capita-1 annually. In 1995, about 535 210 people were involved in the fisheries sector and 44% of these were engaged in small scale marine capture fisheries. Since 1982, Thailand has faced problems with the development of marine capture fisheries and their over-exploitation which has increased fishery conflicts and disputes with neighboring countries. The Gulf of Thailand is the major fishing area of Thailand and in 1996, it contributed approximately 70% of the total marine catch in the country. The catch in the Gulf consisted of pelagic fish (33%), trash fish (32%), demersal fish (12%), squid and cuttlefish (6%), shrimps (5%), crabs (2%) and other fish (10%). However, demersal fish and some pelagic fish in the Gulf of Thailand have been over-exploited. This is due to a combination of factors including; increasing human population, increased pressure from Thai trawlers which have lost access to foreign fishing grounds after neighboring countries declared EEZs, development in fish processing techniques and increasing demand from animal feed producers that utilize trash fish. This paper provides a broad view of the fisheries situation in Thailand, focused mainly on the Gulf of Thailand. It covers aspects of the environment, the status of resources available, the socioeconomic situation, the existing framework for management and development, and also makes recommendations for government action to develop sustainable fisheries management. The main objectives proposed for improving fishery management are: (1) promote fishersÃ† and fisher organizationsÃ† participation in fishery development; (2) optimize fishery resources and their environment so as to be sustainable and equitable; (3) increase fishery products and stabilize fishersÃ† and processorsÃ† incomes; (4) progressively develop deep sea fisheries; (5) improve export competitiveness.Fishery resources, Catch/effort, Population characteristics, Coastal fisheries, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, Fishery policy, Legislation, Fishery management, Demersal fisheries, Pelagic fisheries, Cephalopod fisheries, Socioeconomic aspects, Surveys, Marketing, Fishery organizations, Fishing gear, Cephalopod fisheries, Trade, ISEW, Thailand,",

    "abstract": "This project addresses the constraints to tropical fisheries development with sustainable exploitation through a strategic assessment of tropical fisheries management with the following purposes: (1) To evaluate relevant research methods for the development of assessment models appropriate to the circumstances of tropical coastal fisheries; and (2) To evaluate the utility of existing strategies for the implementation of management advice. The report consists of three substantive chapters. Chapter 2 contains a detailed socio-economic assessment of various instruments and implementation strategies applicable to tropical capture fisheries. In Chapter 3, a detailed assessment of the fisheries for tropical large marine ecosystems has been conducted using a technique developed by FAO (Granger & Garcia 1996). The data used were the FAO statistics published regularly by FAO. This analysis has been conducted for each of the tropical large marine ecosystems and indicates that there is the potential for increased fishing in a number of these ecosystems. One of the clear requirements identified in Chapter 2 and implicit in Chapter 3, is that there is a significant need for simple and robust fisheries assessment methods which can estimate the potential of a particular resource, its capacity in terms of the level of fishing effort and its current status ie whether it is currently exploited sustainably or not. In Chapter 4, these problems are addressed directly and, using two approaches, significant simplification of fishery methods is developed. In the first approach, simple empirical relationships between the life history parameters of a species are used to develop models of potential yield which can be determined by a simple assessment of fish growth. In the second approach, optimal life history theory is applied to the key demographic parameters of exploited fish populations and using estimates of the Beverton & Holt invariants a significant simplifying of the basic stock assessment equations is developed",

    "abstract": "In marine information management, THE ODINAFRICA project participated in training librarians, the creation of a pan-African network of National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), product development and targeted services for national and regional end users. Currently, over 40 marine-related institutions in 25 African countries including Mauritania have tried to address the challenges faced in access to data and information for coastal management. NODC of Mauritania was established in 2001 under the responsibility of the Mauritanian Institute of Oceanographic Research and Fisheries (IMROP). IMROP has developed several products and services such as ODINAFRICA NODC, project websites, newsletters and brochures, ocean data catalogues (metadata), library catalogues, and directories of experts and\r\ninstitutions. IMROP's librarians also participated in several training sessions on the management of marine information. This paper discusses the project’s achievements. A questionnaire was administered to 20 IMROP researchers about their use of products and services and to plan for the maintenance of the various services and databases",

    "abstract": "Ocean data management plays a crucial role in global as well as local matters. The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission -with its network of National Oceanographic Data Centres-  and the International Council of Scientific Unions- with its World Data Centres- have played a major catalysing role in establishing the existing ocean data management practices. No one can think of data management without thinking of information technology. New developments in computer hard- and software force us to continually rethink the way we manage ocean data. One of the major challenges in this is to try and close the gap between the haves and the have-nots, and to assist scientists in less fortunate countries to manage oceanographic data flows in a suitable and timely fashion. So far major emphasis has been on the standardisation and exchange of physical oceanographic data in open ocean conditions. But the colour of the ocean data is changing. The ‘blue’ ocean sciences get increasingly interested in including geological, chemical and biological data. Moreover the shallow sea areas get more and more attention as highly productive biological areas that need to be seen in close association with the deep seas. How to fill in the gap of widely accepted standards for data structures that can serve the deep ‘blue’ and the shallow ‘green’ biological data management is a major issue that has to be addressed. And there is more: data has to be turned into information. In the context of ocean data management, scientists, data managers and decision makers are all very much dependent on each other. Decision makers will stimulate research topics with policy priority and hence guide researchers. Scientists need to provide data managers with reliable and first quality controlled data in such a way that the latter can translate and make them available for the decision makers. But do they speak the same ‘language’? Are they happy with the access they have to the data? And if not, can they learn from each other’s expectations and experience?  The objective of this symposium is to harmonize ocean colours and languages and create a forum for data managers, scientists and decision makers with a major interest in oceanography, and open to everyone interested in ocean data management",

    "abstract": "The mapping and geospatial analysis of benthic environments are multidisciplinary tasks that have become more accessible in recent years because of advances in technology and cost reductions in survey systems. The complex relationships that exist among physical, biological, and chemical seafloor components require advanced, integrated analysis techniques to enable scientists and others to visualize patterns and, in so doing, allow inferences to be made about benthic processes. Effective mapping, analysis, and visualization of marine habitats are particularly important because the subtidal seafloor environment is not readily viewed directly by eye. Research in benthic environments relies heavily, therefore, on remote sensing techniques to collect effective data. Because many benthic scientists are not mapping professionals, they may not adequately consider the links between data collection, data analysis, and data visualization. Projects often start with clear goals, but may be hampered by the technical details and skills required for maintaining data quality through the entire process from collection through analysis and presentation. The lack of technical understanding of the entire data handling process can represent a significant impediment to success.\n\n\n\nWhile many benthic mapping efforts have detailed their methodology as it relates to the overall scientific goals of a project, only a few published papers and reports focus on the analysis and visualization components (Paton et al. 1997, Weihe et al. 1999, Basu and Saxena 1999, Bruce et al. 1997). In particular, the benthic mapping literature often briefly describes data collection and analysis methods, but fails to provide sufficiently detailed explanation of particular analysis techniques or display methodologies so that others can employ them. In general, such techniques are in large part guided by the data acquisition methods, which can include both aerial and water-based remote sensing methods to map the seafloor without physical disturbance, as well as physical sampling methodologies (e.g., grab or core sampling).\n\n\n\nThe terms benthic mapping and benthic habitat mapping are often used synonymously to describe seafloor mapping conducted for the purpose of benthic habitat identification. There is a subtle yet important difference, however, between general benthic mapping and benthic habitat mapping. The distinction is important because it dictates the sequential analysis and visualization techniques that are employed following data collection. In this paper general seafloor mapping for identification of regional geologic features and morphology is defined as benthic mapping. Benthic habitat mapping incorporates the regional scale geologic information but also includes higher resolution surveys and analysis of biological communities to identify the biological habitats. In addition, this paper adopts the definition of habitats established by Kostylev et al. (2001) as a “spatially defined area where the physical, chemical, and biological environment is distinctly different from the surrounding environment.”  (PDF contains 31 pages",

    "abstract": "Background: Understanding the distribution of marine biodiversity is a crucial first step towards the effective and sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Recent efforts to collate location records from marine surveys enable us to assemble a global picture of recorded marine biodiversity. They also effectively highlight gaps in our knowledge of particular marine regions. In particular, the deep pelagic ocean - the largest biome on Earth - is chronically under-represented in global databases of marine biodiversity.\n\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We use data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System to plot the position in the water column of ca 7 million records of marine species occurrences. Records from relatively shallow waters dominate this global picture of recorded marine biodiversity. In addition, standardising the number of records from regions of the ocean differing in depth reveals that regardless of ocean depth, most records come either from surface waters or the sea bed. Midwater biodiversity is drastically under-represented.\n\n\n\nConclusions/Significance: The deep pelagic ocean is the largest habitat by volume on Earth, yet it remains biodiversity's big wet secret, as it is hugely under-represented in global databases of marine biological records. Given both its value in the provision of a range of ecosystem services, and its vulnerability to threats including overfishing and climate change, there is a pressing need to increase our knowledge of Earth's largest ecosystem",

    "abstract": "IIThe coral reefs of Honduras are of vital national and international importance,both ecologically and economically, but are threatened because of rapid economicand population growth.? During work on Utila between 1999 and 2000 (the ?Bay Islands 2000? project),Coral Cay Conservation developed a programme of surveys, training andconservation education aimed at assessing the status of local reefs and improvingenvironmental awareness amongst neighbouring communities.? This summary report provides an overview of the habitat mapping data collectedby the Bay Islands 2000 project.? CASA provided software, hardware and skills, on a charitable basis to ensure thatthe data collected by CCC could be developed into a GIS, not only for mappingthe status of the coral reefs of Honduras, but also to provide analysis of the aerialextent of these reefs.? Data were collected within individual ?study areas?, to facilitate analysis at a rangeof spatial scales, and utilised the CCC standard baseline survey technique for therapid assessment of the characteristics of reef communities. The surveys,therefore, utilised a series of transects, perpendicular to the reef.? Baseline transects discriminated nine benthic and six geomorpholgical classeswhich indicates Utila has a high habitat diversity. Habitat diversity is importantsince the number of habitat types has been shown to be a good representation ofspecies biodiversity.? The nine benthic classes that were distinguished were all relatively coral poorbecause of a suite of relatively long-term local and regional factors, exacerbatedby the combination of Hurricane Mitch and coral bleaching in 1995 and 1998.? Damselfish were the most abundant reef associated fish recorded during baselinetransect surveys. Commercially important fish were less abundant that wouldnormally be expected in unfished systems.? A recurring pattern in the baseline transect data was the greater abundance anddiversity of fish in coral rich classes. However, although the link between fishabundance and coral cover was clear, not all species were necessarily mostabundant in the most coral rich areas.? Invertebrates were generally uncommon, partly because of fishing pressure, andthe abundances of many invertebrate taxa were correlated with coral cover.? A habitat map is presented within this report as an indication of the distribution ofhabitat types around Utila.? Using the map, estimates of areal extents of each benthic class and habitat type areinstructive. For example, there is only approximately 27 km2 of reefal habitatsaround Utila. Furthermore, the area supporting the most coral rich benthic classesis only approximately 4 km2 (15%). These statistics both highlight the damagecaused by the bleaching event and Hurricane Mitch and other anthropogenicimpacts and the need to conserve remaining coral rich areas.? If further reserves were to be created, it would be important to try to protect arange of reef and habitat types. For this reason, it appears that the Turtle HarbourWildlife Refuge is well placed since this areas includes a wide range of habitattypes. However, placement of reserves in Utila should favour relatively coral richhabitats over sand dominated areas.? This study led to six recommendations:Summary Utila habitat mapping reportIII? One or more agencies should collect additional ground-truthing data fromaround Utila to facilitate both classification of currently ?Unknown? polygonsand an accuracy assessment of the map.? Establish an integrated GIS and associated meta-database for Utila, includingdata from the Bay Islands 2000 project.? Examine the potential of using data collected by the Bay Islands 2000 projectas the basis of national habitat classification scheme and subsequent nationalhabitat map.? Continue to aim to establish one or more additional multiple use marineprotected areas around Utila, with an integrated monitoring programme tomeasure their efficacy, and strengthen the enforcement of regulations in theTurtle Harbour Wildlife Sanctuary. Establish regulations, and enforce existinglegislation, to minimise the detrimental effects of coastal development on reefhealth.? Additional marine reserves in Utila should integrate factors such as thepreference of many fish species for coral rich habitats and the protection ofareas incorporating a range of habitat types, including mangroves and seagrassbeds, in order to allow for nursery areas, ontogenetic shifts and species thatrely on non-coral rich habitats. The corollary of the preference of fish speciesfor coral rich habitats is to protect coral cover within the reserves.? The reef on the south coast of Utila appears to be a good candidate forprotection because it is relatively sheltered from storm and hurricane damage",

A prerequisite for sustainable\n\nocean governance, including the designation of marine protected areas to conserve threatened\n\necosystems or habitats, is, therefore, the availability of good bathymetric maps. Despite decades\n\nof ocean mapping, we still lack this detailed bathymetric information over large parts of the\n\nAtlantic seafloor. In an effort to change this situation, the US, Canadian and EU governments,\n\nunder the “Galway Statement on Atlantic Ocean Cooperation,” established an Atlantic Seabed\n\nMapping International Working Group (ASMIWG) to develop plans to map the entire Atlantic. A\n\nfirst step in this effort is to define 400 x 400 km target areas for a pilot mapping project. Here we\n\npresent the selection algorithm used to define these pilot areas based on carefully chosen and\n\npublicly available parameters of the marine environment that are of interest to various\n\nstakeholders. The methodology involved a GIS-based overlay technique that included the\n\nparameters of the marine environment as individual layers and combined them in order to obtain\n\ninformation about the suitability of a location as a target area.

    "abstract": "Hydrographic training entered a new era when students arrived at the University of New Hampshire in August of 2004 to form the first class of the Nippon Foundation GEBCO (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans) training program. Born out of the need to replenish GEBCO’s aging human material, and of the desire to spread deep ocean mapping capabilities more widely throughout the world, the program attracted applications from 57 students in over thirty countries. The seven selected each had post graduate training and several years experience, but differed in that three were hydrographers, two geologists and two oceanographers. Classes planned for the next two years will bring in a further fourteen students. The UNH program had been selected as the closest match to the general course requirements GEBCO considered that ocean bathymetrists should have. Subjects include all types of depth measurements, oceanography, acoustics, tides, plate tectonics, sea floor morphology, ocean basins, sedimentary processes, hydrothermal-thermal processes, gravity-magnetic relationships to seafloor fabrics, positioning and geodesy, maps and charts, IHO standards, GIS, data bases, gridding, contouring, spatial statistics, and the history of GEBCO and ocean mapping. These are taught at the graduate level as part of the graduate degree program at UNH. In this paper, the experiences that participants from the different backgrounds underwent are recounted with the overall goal of improving the general education required to map the floors of the deep ocean. Recommendations are made regarding the prior preparation of students entering the program, the content and intensity of courses comprising the program, and follow-up actions to solidify the learning experience. Intangibles such as the networking of professional contacts are also evaluated. Extrapolations to training in other areas of hydrography are made",

    "abstract": "This report describes cases relating to the management of national marine sanctuaries in which certain scientific information was required so managers could make decisions that effectively protected trust resources. The cases presented represent only a fraction of difficult issues that marine sanctuary managers deal with daily. They include, among others, problems related to wildlife disturbance, vessel routing, marine reserve placement, watershed management, oil spill response, and habitat restoration. Scientific approaches to address these problems vary significantly, and include literature surveys, data mining, field studies (monitoring, mapping, observations, and measurement), geospatial and biogeographic analysis, and modeling. In most cases there is also an element of expert consultation and collaboration among multiple partners, agencies with resource protection responsibilities, and other users and stakeholders. The resulting management responses may involve direct intervention (e.g., for spill response or habitat restoration issues), proposal of boundary alternatives for marine sanctuaries or reserves, changes in agency policy or regulations, making recommendations to other agencies with resource protection responsibilities, proposing changes to international or domestic shipping rules, or development of new education or outreach programs.

    "abstract": "Ice-bound, wild and remote, the Weddell Sea is a large, deep embayment nestled between the Antarctic Peninsula and Cape Norvegia. Lying south of the Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the most intact ecosystems in the world.At its widest, it is 2,000 km across, with the whole region encompassing 3.4 million km. The Weddell Sea has often been inaccessible to humans, but as research has increased over the past few decades, a picture has emerged of a vibrant marine ecosystem sustained by a combination of currents, seafloor features and ice.This research has revealed incredible biodiversity, particularly on the seafloor, with dozens of new species discovered on recent sampling expeditions. There are many more species yet to be discovered. Several species of whales and dolphins and six species of seals are found in the Weddell Sea, as well as a diversity of fish and seabirds. Even at depths of 6,000 metres, life has been found, underscoring the incredible diversity of life in the region. Nutrient rich currents interact with seafloor features, sea ice and ice shelves in a complex system that results in hotspots of plankton growth on the surface, supporting life from the surface to the ocean depths. The complexity of the Weddell Sea's region's undersea landscape enhances the diversity of life under the waves and ice by creating varied habitats for different undersea animals.The enormous richness of life generated by these interactions supports many seabird and mammal species including emperor penguins, Weddell, crab eater, and elephant seals as well as minke, humpback, blue, and fin whales. These animals come to feed on krill and silverfish, found in the many areas of high phytoplankton production (also known as \"primary productivity\") throughout the region. Yet climate change is having major impacts on the region with disruption to the icy environment. Changes in sea ice could be devastating for many species whose life cycle depends on pack ice. Protecting the unique, ecologically intact, and diverse deep-water regions of the Weddell Sea in a system of large-scale marine reserves and MPAs would ensure that its rich benthic biodiversity, krill populations, and large predators (including whales) continue to thrive",

    "abstract": "Satellite applications are being used in land, sea, air and space studies and management applications in the sea covering a wide spectrum of fields, such as oceanography (bathymetry, tides, waves, sea level, currents, surface water temperature), fisheries (resources distribution and monitoring of fisheries), shipping (fleet monitoring, communication, safety and rescue, pollution detection and monitoring), and navy (security, strategy, safety). Further, satellites can be used in the process of educating people onboard. The present research is a study of three satellite applications for Ocean and Coastal Zone Management (OCZM). Radar sensors which are used in bathymetric exploration are useful in the oil pipeline industry and in coastal navigation. Thermal and radar imaging have been used to detect indirectly the resource distribution of the tuna fisheries and lately also other fisheries. The Global Position System (GPS) and data communications today permit fleet monitoring, although the focus of this dissertation is on the fishing fleet. The development of any fleet monitoring system can follow the same principle. An interesting point is the cost — although this technology may appear expensive, it is in effect not. One of the objectives of this dissertation is to compare the value of traditional methods and satellite applications. With this I intend to give a new perspective of the capabilities of the new technology and its application in developing countries. The Ocean and Coastal Zone (OCZ) is a very wide area. Normally, the control and monitoring of this would take days, if traditional systems are used, and all analyses would be post-facto. Satellites can provide a wide variety of applications besides data communications technology. They can send position, type of vessel, speed, and other parameters in near-real time and therefore the ability of OCZM can be substantially increased. Herein lies the interest in exploring the employment of satellites as OCZ management tools. The methodology followed in the development of this paper is to conduct an analysis of remote sensing capabilities. This includes comparing remote sensing images and data with traditional methods of obtaining and analysing data for the management of the natural resources within the coastal and ocean areas of a country. In addition, Internet capabilities and library resources have been used extensively to research the arena of satellite science",

    "abstract": "The possible applications of satellite technology in marine geodesy and geodetic related ocean physics were investigated. Four major problems were identified in the areas of geodesy and ocean physics: (1) geodetic positioning and control establishment; (2) sea surface topography and geoid determination; (3) geodetic applications to ocean physics; and (4) ground truth establishment. It was found that satellite technology can play a major role in their solution. For solution of the first problem, the use of satellite geodetic techniques, such as Doppler and C-band radar ranging, is demonstrated to fix the three-dimensional coordinates of marine geodetic control if multi-satellite passes are used. The second problem is shown to require the use of satellite altimetry, along with accurate knowledge of ocean-dynamics parameters such as sea state, ocean tides, and mean sea level. The use of both conventional and advanced satellite techniques appeared to be necessary to solve the third and fourth problems",

    "abstract": "In contrast to generally sparse biological communities in open-ocean settings, seamounts and ridges are perceived as areas of elevated productivity and biodiversity capable of supporting commercial fisheries. We investigated the origin of this apparent biological enhancement over a segment of the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) using sonar, corers, trawls, traps, and a remotely operated vehicle to survey habitat, biomass, and biodiversity. Satellite remote sensing provided information on flow patterns, thermal fronts, and primary production, while sediment traps measured export flux during 2007-2010. The MAR, 3,704,404 km 2 in area, accounts for 44.7% lower bathyal habitat (800-3500 m depth) in the North Atlantic and is dominated by fine soft sediment substrate (95% of area) on a series of flat terraces with intervening slopes either side of the ridge axis contributing to habitat heterogeneity. The MAR fauna comprises mainly species known from continental margins with no evidence of greater biodiversity. Primary production and export flux over the MAR were not enhanced compared with a nearby reference station over the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Biomasses of benthic macrofauna and megafauna were similar to global averages at the same depths totalling an estimated 258.9 kt C over the entire lower bathyal north MAR. A hypothetical flat plain at 3500 m depth in place of the MAR would contain 85.6 kt C, implying an increase of 173.3 kt C attributable to the presence of the Ridge. This is approximately equal to 167 kt C of estimated pelagic biomass displaced by the volume of the MAR. There is no enhancement of biological productivity over the MAR; oceanic bathypelagic species are replaced by benthic fauna otherwise unable to survive in the mid ocean. We propose that globally sea floor elevation has no effect on deep sea biomass; pelagic plus benthic biomass is constant within a given surface productivity regime.Peer reviewe",

This document draws on MMA experiences worldwide by synthesizing results from over 25 natural science studies conducted over the past five years in 18 tropical countries in 48 MMAs. The analysis focuses on the role of MMAs in maintaining healthy oceans, showing that MMAs can be used to enhance fisheries outside their borders and safeguard threatened species. Conserving multiple habitats using MMAs can also protect diverse livelihoods and increase fisheries yields. Local protection of marine resources through the MMA process can provide strong local benefits to species, habitats, and people. Local protection buffers against global climate change impacts while maintaining the richness of marine life. Finally, MMAs benefit by using new scientific approaches and engaging citizen scientists",

The aim of this paper is to identify how these contributions of fisheries and aquaculture to poverty reduction and food security can be enhanced while also addressing the need for a sustainability transition in over-exploited and over-capitalized capture fisheries, and for improved environmental performance and distributive justice in a rapidly growing aquaculture sector. The focus of the paper is on the poverty and food security concerns of developing countries, with an emphasis on the least developed. The emphasis is on food security rather than poverty reduction policies and strategies, although the two are of course related. The food security agenda is very much to the fore at present; fish prices rose along with other food prices in 2007-8 and as fish provide important nutritional benefits to the poor, food security has become a primary concern for sector policy.Aquaculture, Food security, Fisheries, Nutrition",

    "abstract": "Fisheries change often carries its own financial rewards. Many reforms and changes which support conservation also result in higher profits and revenue streams for the involved businesses. This makes fisheries a potentially attractive investment arena for many commercial investors, once reform projects are properly structured and agreed upon between conservationists and the involved businesses. As commercial investors and social investors become more involved in the field of fisheries, the scale of the impacts that can be achieved is expected to expand. Foundations in the field are now looking to support this transition from fisheries conservation as a purely philanthropic investment to a blended conservation and business investment by encouraging non-profits, social change leaders and business entrepreneurs to create innovatively structured projects that can both build value for private investors and improve the speed and scale of fisheries conservation impacts. This report aims to support this transition, by providing information about and high-lighting the work of those at the forefront of innovative fisheries finance",

The design of these strategies reflects, to the best of our understanding, the unique characteristics of the countries studied. We recognize that these strategies will evolve through further research and development and will vary meaningfully in their design and execution depending on the specific characteristics of the fisheries and countries where they may be deployed. We hope that these strategies can be adopted, modified and executed by a range of public, private, and non-profit players over time, and that the execution of these or similar strategies will catalyze the flow of new sources of private capital towards sustainable fisheries with positive environmental and societal impacts",

Strengthening Governance of Small-Scale Fisheries: An Initial Assessment of Theory and Practice. Oak Foundation.Often hidden in national statistics, small-scale fisheries have been poorly measured at a global level, and in thepast often ignored in states' policy-making. Yet estimates suggest their aggregate global contribution tonutrition, food security and poverty eradication is massive. The most recent estimates available suggest thatsmall-scale fisheries account for over 90 percent of the world's commercial fishers, processors and otherpersons employed along the value chain, equivalent to over 108 million people. Roughly half areemployed in the ocean and the other half in inland fisheries—making small-scale fisheries far and awaythe ocean's largest employer (greater than oil and gas, shipping, tourism, etc.). This level of activitytranslates into a large portion of the global fish catch: an estimated 46 percent of the total, and 38 percentof the fish caught in the ocean. SSFs are also estimated to provide over half the animal protein intake inmany of the world's least developed countries, and over half of the fish for domestic consumption indeveloping countries more broadly. In sum, in many regions of the world SSFs provide both incomes tohelp reduce poverty and safety nets to help prevent it",

    "abstract": "Chemical dispersants were employed on an unprecedented scale during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and could be a response option should a large spill occur in Arctic waters. The use of dispersants in response to that spill raised concerns regarding the need for chemical dispersants, the fate of the oil and dispersants, and their potential impacts on human health and the environment. Concerns remain that would be more evident in the Arctic, where the remoteness and harsh environmental conditions would make a response to any oil spill very difficult. An outcome of a 2013 Arctic oil spill exercise for senior federal agency leadership identified the need for an evaluation of the state-of-the-science of dispersants and dispersed oil (DDO), and a clear delineation of the associated uncertainties that remain, particularly as they apply to Arctic waters.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in partnership with the Coastal Response Research Center (CRRC), and in consultation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) embarked on a project to seek expert review and evaluation of the state-of-the-science and the uncertainties involving DDO. The project focused on five areas and how they might be affected by Arctic conditions: dispersant effectiveness, distribution and fate, transport and chemical behavior, environmental impacts, and public health and safety. This publication (1 of 5) addresses efficacy and effectiveness",

    "abstract": "From the Preface: The purpose of this document is to motivate and coordinate U.S. participation in the Second\r\nInternational Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) by outlining a core set of research priorities that\r\nwill accelerate our understanding of geologic, oceanic, and atmospheric processes and their\r\ninteractions in the Indian Ocean. These research priorities have been developed by the U.S.\r\nIIOE-2 Steering Committee based on the outcomes of an interdisciplinary Indian Ocean science\r\nworkshop held at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on September 11-13, 2017. The\r\nworkshop was attended by 70 scientists with expertise spanning climate, atmospheric sciences,\r\nand multiple sub-disciplines of oceanography. Workshop participants were largely drawn from\r\nU.S. academic institutions and government agencies, with a few experts invited from India,\r\nChina, and France to provide a broader perspective on international programs and activities and\r\nopportunities for collaboration. These research priorities also build upon the previously\r\ndeveloped International IIOE-2 Science Plan and Implementation Strategy. Outcomes from the\r\nworkshop are condensed into five scientific themes: Upwelling, inter-ocean exchanges,\r\nmonsoon dynamics, inter-basin contrasts, marine geology and the deep ocean. Each theme is\r\nidentified with priority questions that the U.S. research community would like to address and the\r\nmeasurements that need to be made in the Indian Ocean to address them.We thank the following organizations and programs for financial contributions, support\r\nand endorsement: the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the U.S.\r\nOcean Carbon and Biogeochemistry program funded by the National Science\r\nFoundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the NASA Physical\r\nOceanography Program; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; and the Indo-US Science\r\nand Technology Forum",

    "abstract": "The Arctic is undergoing rapid transformations that have brought the Arctic Ocean to the top of international political agendas. Predicting future conditions of the Arctic Ocean system requires scientific knowledge of its present status as well as a process-based understanding of the mechanisms of change. The Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) initiative is an integrative, international, interdisciplinary pan-Arctic program to study changes and feedbacks among the physical and biogeochemical components of the Arctic Ocean and their ultimate impacts on biological productivity. The goal of ART is to develop priorities for Arctic marine science over the next decade. Three overarching questions form the basis of the ART science plan:\n\n(1) How were past transitions in sea ice connected to energy flows, elemental cycling, biological diversity and productivity, and how do these compare to present and\n\nprojected shifts?\n\n(2) How will biogeochemical cycling respond to transitions in terrestrial, gateway and shelf-to-basin fluxes?\n\n(3) How do Arctic Ocean organisms and ecosystems respond to environmental transitions including temperature, stratification, ice conditions, and pH? \n\nThe integrated approach developed to answer the ART key scientific questions comprises: (a) process studies and observations to reveal mechanisms, (b) the establishment of links to existing monitoring programs, (c) the evaluation of geological records to extend time-series, and (d) the improvement of our modeling capabilities of climate-induced transitions. In order to develop an implementation plan for the ART initiative, an international and interdisciplinary workshop is currently planned to take place in Winnipeg, Canada in October 2010",

    "abstract": "The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Ocean State Report (OSR) provides an annual report of the state of the global ocean and European regional seas for policy and decision-makers with the additional aim of increasing general public awareness about the status of, and changes in, the marine environment. The CMEMS OSR draws on expert analysis and provides a 3-D view (through reanalysis systems), a view from above (through remote-sensing data) and a direct view of the interior (through in situ measurements) of the global ocean and the European regional seas. The report is based on the unique CMEMS monitoring capabilities of the blue (hydrography, currents), white (sea ice) and green (e.g. Chlorophyll) marine environment. This first issue of the CMEMS OSR provides guidance on Essential Variables, large-scale changes and specific events related to the physical ocean state over the period 1993–2015. Principal findings of this first CMEMS OSR show a significant increase in global and regional sea levels, thermosteric expansion, ocean heat content, sea surface temperature and Antarctic sea ice extent and conversely a decrease in Arctic sea ice extent during the 1993–2015 period. During the year 2015 exceptionally strong large-scale changes were monitored such as, for example, a strong El Niño Southern Oscillation, a high frequency of extreme storms and sea level events in specific regions in addition to areas of high sea level and harmful algae blooms. At the same time, some areas in the Arctic Ocean experienced exceptionally low sea ice extent and temperatures below average were observed in the North Atlantic Ocean",

The definitive version was published in Oceanography 27, no. 1 (2014): 196–213, doi:10.5670/oceanog.2014.23.Four decades of research have provided a reasonable understanding of the outline of the biogeochemical cycles of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coastal ocean and surface ocean ecosystems, including atmospheric transport to the sea, air-sea exchange processes, and the role of particulate matter in removing these chemicals from surface waters. It is clear that deep ocean fish are contaminated with POPs. However, despite available sampling and analytical capabilities, deep ocean ecosystems are much less sampled and understood. A multidecade assessment of POPs and PAHs in US coastal waters using bivalve sentinel organisms documents high concentrations near urban areas and also some stations where concentrations have begun to decline. The results are consistent with coastal sediments near urban areas being a leaky sink for POPs and PAHs, and sources from land continuing to contribute these contaminants to the sea. Other studies document coastal and continental margin surface sediments as a sink, albeit a potentially leaky sink, for POPs and PAHs. Floating plastic debris, including small pellets, has reemerged as an oceanic environmental concern. A \"Pellet Watch\" assessing plastic pellets and associated POPs and PAHs is underway. Enhanced studies of deep-ocean ecosystems are recommended. The findings are also relevant to biogeochemical cycles for emerging organic pollutants",

Researchers and operational users currently use satellite altimeter data products with the GSFCOO NASA data model to obtain sea-surface height and ocean circulation inforrnation.

The hand book describes the utilities of satellite-based technologies in marine fisheries and emphasizes the need for expanding our vision for satellite based technologies beyond Remote Sensing. The protocols described, with sufficient illustrations in the handbook will serve as a handy tool for incorporating spatial data in marine fisheries distribution, management and conservation studies. The hand book also provides   guidelines and precautions for fishery researchers while analyzing marine fisheries data on a GIS platform. Further, the book suggests methods toincorporate GISroutines to study fisheries in relation to variability in environmental and ecological characteristics. The prospects of GIS based studiesin developingMonitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) in fisheries management with Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and marine spatial planning for sustainable development of fisheries and mariculture are also discussed in the handbook",

    "abstract": "Executive Summary:\n\n\n\nThe Estuary Restoration Act of 2000 (ERA), Title I of the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of 2000, was created to promote the restoration of habitats along the coast of the United States (including the US protectorates and the Great Lakes). The NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science was charged with the development of a guidance manual for monitoring plans under this Act.\n\n\n\nThis guidance manual, titled Science-Based Restoration Monitoring of Coastal Habitats, is written in two volumes. It provides technical assistance, outlines necessary steps, and provides useful tools for the development and implementation of sound scientific monitoring of coastal restoration efforts. In addition, this manual offers a means to detect early warnings that the restoration is on track or not, to gauge how well a restoration site is functioning, to coordinate projects and efforts for consistent and successful restoration, and to evaluate the ecological health of specific coastal habitats both before and after project completion (Galatowitsch et al. 1998).\n\n\n\nThe following habitats have been selected for discussion in this manual: water column, rock bottom, coral reefs, oyster reefs, soft bottom, kelp and other macroalgae, rocky shoreline, soft shoreline, submerged aquatic vegetation, marshes, mangrove swamps, deepwater swamps, and riverine forests. The classification of habitats used in this document is generally based on that of Cowardin et al. (1979) in their Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States, as called for in the ERA Estuary Habitat Restoration Strategy.\n\n\n\nThis manual is not intended to be a restoration monitoring “cookbook” that provides templates of monitoring plans for specific habitats. The interdependence of a large number of site-specific factors causes habitat types to vary in physical and biological structure within and between regions and geographic locations (Kusler and Kentula 1990). Monitoring approaches used should be tailored to these differences. However, even with the diversity of habitats that may need to be restored and the extreme geographic range across which these habitats occur, there are consistent principles and approaches that form a common basis for effective monitoring.\n\n\n\nVolume One, titled A Framework for Monitoring Plans under the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of 2000, begins with definitions and background information. Topics such as restoration, restoration monitoring, estuaries, and the role of socioeconomics in restoration are discussed. In addition, the habitats selected for discussion in this manual are briefly described. (PDF contains 116 pages",

    "abstract": "Feeding ecology explains predator’s preference to some preys over others in their habitat and their competitions&nbsp;thereof. The subject, as a functional and applied biology, is highly neglected, and in case of fish, a uniform and&nbsp;consistent methodology is absent. The currently practiced methods are largely centred on mathematical indices&nbsp;and highly erroneous because of non-uniform outcomes. Therefore, it requires a relook into the subject to&nbsp;elucidate functional contributions and to make it more comparable and comprehensive science. In this article,&nbsp;approachable methodological strategies have been forwarded in three hierarchical steps, namely, food occurrence,&nbsp;feeding biology and interpretative ecology. All these steps involve wide ranges of techniques, within the&nbsp;scope of ecology but not limited to, and traverse from narrative to functional evolutionary ecology. The first step&nbsp;is an assumption-observation practice to assess food of fish, followed by feeding biology that links morphological,&nbsp;histological, cytological, bacteriological or enzymological correlations to preferred food in the environment.&nbsp;Interpretative ecology is the higher level of analysis in which the outcomes are tested and discussed against&nbsp;evolutionary theories. A description of possible pedagogics on the methods of feeding ecological studies has&nbsp;also been forwarded",

    "abstract": "The history of fisheries research in India goes back to the early 19th century,\n\nwhen dried or preserved material was sent to the Museums of Natural History in\n\nEngland and other European countries for identification and cataloguing (Silas,\n\n2003). Some of the earliest scientific observations on fisheries in pre-independent\n\nIndia were the works of Francis Hamilton-Buchanan (1822) and Francis Day,\n\nwhose initial work on ‘The Fishes of Malabar’ (1865), was followed by a\n\nmonograph on ‘The Fishes of India’ (1875-78); and two more volumes on ‘Fishes’\n\nin ‘The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma’ (1889).\n\nThe enactment of Indian Fisheries Act of 1897 was a major landmark in the\n\ndevelopment of fisheries in pre-independent India. In the latter half of 19th century,\n\nemphasis on coastal and deep-water surveys in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman\n\nSea led to possession of valuable information on new deepwater fauna of fishes\n\nand crustaceans, hydrology and plankton. The initial work by the Zoological\n\nSurvey of India on fisheries and marine biology through eminent leadership of its\n\nDirectors, viz. Nelsen Annandale, Stanley Kemp, Seymour Sewell, Baini Prasad\n\nand S. L. Hora during first half of the 20th century led to generation of several\n\nfirst hand information on the taxonomy, bionomics, eco-biology, hydrology, and\n\nfish and fisheries of upland lakes, rivers and coastal waters. The emphasis shifted\n\nfrom coastal and deep-water surveys in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to\n\nupland lakes, rivers and coastal waters in the beginning of the 20th century. With\n\nthe establishment of the Bureau of Fisheries in 1907, the Madras Presidency\n\nbecame the pioneer for fisheries development in India. Establishment of the Marine\n\nBiological Station at Krusadai Island in 1924 and subsequently at West Hill and\n\nEnnore led to organized research programmes on pearl and chank fisheries in the\n\nGulf of Mannar",

A particular focus for this work has been the concept of participative governance and the co-management systems in which responsibility for management is shared between the world, regions, states and user groups, usually at the local level. Governance in the context of fisheries is divided in this article to three levels: the first dealing with issues of legal instruments, the second concerned with institutions and the third focusing on the construction of mechanism of management, in terms of economic, social and environmental values and principles to guide fisheries policy making along a consistent path of case study of fisheries governance in Azores.N/",

The critique shows that some courses are highly under-weighted e.g. &ldquo;Aquatic Flora and fauna&rdquo; as a 2 credit unit. There is a high degree of overlap between courses. Some are not clearly and sharply delineated, defined or described. Staff needs are not defined or described. Staff needs are not defined in terms of core course areas of specialization. Limnology & Oceanography have their descriptions restricted to physico ? chemical features and not viewed in the desired comparative perspective. Suggestions are made on a wider listing of equipment, field laboratory, and library need to sharpen the NUC guideline. A review committee is recommended",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this field guide is to provide information on nonindigenous (i.e., non-native) fishes that have been observed in Florida’s marine waters. Introductions of non-native marine fishes into Florida’s waters could be intentional or unintentional, and are likely from a variety of sources, including aquarium releases, escape from aquaculture, loss due to extreme weather events (e.g., flooding from hurricanes), and possibly transfer with ballast water or hull-fouling. Presently the lionfishes (Pterois volitans and P. miles) are the only non-native marine fish species known to be established along the coast of Florida. All other marine fishes in this guide (except the euryhaline species, see below) have infrequent occurrences, occur singly or in small groups, and have not yet become self-sustaining populations. \n\n\n\nAquarium releases are one of the major pathways whereby nonindigenous fishes gain access to new environments (Ruiz et al. 1997; Fuller et al. 1999). Most of the nonindigenous marine fishes found in Florida’s waters are thought to be aquarium fishes that either were illegally released into the ocean or escaped captivity (e.g., during severe storm/flooding events). Indeed, south Florida is a hotspot for nonindigenous marine aquarium fishes (Semmens et al. 2004). Increased public awareness of the problems caused by released or escaped aquarium fishes may aid in stemming the frequency of releases. For example, HabitattitudeTM (www.habitattitude.net) is a national public awareness and partnership campaign that encourages aquarists and water gardeners to prevent the release of unwanted aquarium plants, fish and other animals. It prompts hobbyists to adopt alternative actions when dealing with these aquatic plants and animals. (PDF file contains 133 pages.",

As a result, many coastal habitats around the United States are in desperate need of restoration.

This task of evaluating the adequacy of nautical chart products poses a challenge to many national hydrographic offices. This stems from the dearth of readily available spatial information: namely, the lack of reliable and accessible vessel traffic data, and little means to assess the changing nature of both near-shore bathymetry and shoreline in a simple and reliable manner. In this paper, we present the potential use of automatic-identification system (AIS) data, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), and airborne-lidar bathymetry (ALB) to provide an operational procedure for evaluating the adequacy and completeness of information of NOAA charts. Preliminary results from three U.S. study sites are presented in this paper: Nantucket Sound, MA; Barnegat Bay Inlet, NJ; and Barataria Bay, LA. Based on the publically-available datasets it was possible to identify changes in the charts and develop a reconnaissance procedure to monitor these changes on a yearly basis",

    "abstract": "Bathymetry is the study of the bed under the water\\u27s surface, giving us the water\\u27s depth. The Thesis will be about studying the coastal area of the UAE by using satellite images that can help access large regions of the UAE Coast. Also, by using a history of 5 years of satellite visible bands and NIR images, we can see the change of depth near the coastal. The benefit of that study will help to build ship baths through shallow water and to go in and out of ports of UAE. Early warnings of the sea level increasing near the urban areas near the coastal zone by Global warming is the main reason for the increase of sea level, which will change the depth of the location of fishing in the UAE sea. A coastal bathymetry study will help clarify the best place for fishing areas. All these studies can be done by remote sensing satellites in the visible range and NIR (Near Infrared).Knowledge of bathymetry is crucial for maritime applications, such as shipping, dredging, navigation, and engineering constructions. Marine applications have received help from recent advancements in satellite navigation technology, which can use multispectral bands to retrieve water depth information. Hence, this proposes to develop a coastal bathymetric map of areas of the UAE coast using optical satellite data and analyze the quality and accuracy of the derived bathymetric map. To derive the bathymetry of water areas, different algorithms are used in mapping the bathymetry. This project will use the linear band ratio (Ratio of Green and Blue bands) to derive the bathymetry map for Al Fujairah port and Delma Island using sentinel 2 Level 1C imagery. Multiple tools were used in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) to derive the bathymetry of the two areas. The bathymetry derivation process implemented A set of procedures, including atmospheric correction, resampling, land masking, sun de-glint, and dark object subtraction. The Sen2coral processor was then used to manually confirm the steps using the software\\u27s sun de-glint and bathymetry deriving plugins",

At the 2012 Canada Hydro conference, a study was presented on the potential use of Landsat satellite imagery to map shallow-water bathymetry in a GIS environment over three study sites. Since then, several collaborations between the current study group and various hydrographic organizations were established with the goal of implementing optically-derived bathymetry as part of their data acquiring procedure. Bathymetry over additional study sites around the world was tested. Also, different commercial software packages were evaluated to provide an affordable processing platform for hydrographic offices in developing countries. In this paper, an overview will be provided on the advances that have been achieved in the past year and an update and future directions of the study",

    "abstract": "Chart adequacy and completeness information consists of the symbols, abbreviations and warnings used to inform mariners of the level of confidence that should be given to data on a nautical chart. This information is derived both from the nautical chart and sailing directions. However, analysis based solely on these datasets is limited without access to the sources (e.g., smooth sheets). Publically-available, multi-spectral satellite imagery and published algorithms can be used to derive estimates of the relative bathymetry in shallow, clear waters. In this study, we evaluate the potential of these methods for supplementing the procedure to assess the adequacy of hydrographic surveying and nautical charting coverage. Optically-derived bathymetry provides information in areas that have not been surveyed and monitor any seafloor changes that may have occurred since the last survey of the area. Preliminary results show that multi-spectral satellite remote sensing is also potentially beneficial as a reconnaissance tool prior to a hydrographic acoustic survey",

Specifically, existing data will be converted into Marine Information Objects (MIOs) conforming to IHO S-57 data standards that become a supplemental information layer to be used with Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC) in ECDIS. The project goal is to strengthen marine resource conservation by bringing critical coral, MPA, and other environmental protection-related information to the marine r. This effort will also contribute to an initiative by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) to incorporate nautical chart symbology for coral reefs and MPAs. In particular, designated areas will be symbolized as Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSAs). This project involves a number of stakeholders (e.g., mariners, hydrographers, conservationists, scientists, and resource managers) who are interested in both safety of navigation and marine environmental conservation",

World Ocean Council, with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, undertook a project to inform and, as appropriate, engage a diverse range of ocean industries on marine planning and encourage the use of credible science and risk assessment.The project identified industry sectors and business categories and researched industry perspectives on marine planning in part through the following five case studies. These case studies were selected to provide a broad range of regions across the globe and MSP examples at different stages of design, implementation, monitoring and adaptive management. The case studies are based on interviews with many private sector and government sector participants of planning processes, online documents, maps and available information, and a review of MSP literature. Stakeholder feedback, benefits and challenges from these five case studies are incorporated into the WOC report Ocean Industries and Marine Planning.",

    "abstract": "As of 2011, the Caribbean Sea was one of the only fisheries unoccupied by China’s Distant Water Fleet (DWF). However, in 2016, officials from the People’s Republic of China and the Bahamas discussed a proposal for a bilateral commercial fishing agreement in Bahamian waters. An official agreement was never proposed, but given the notoriety of China’s DFW and the Bahamas’ monitoring and enforcement problems, such an agreement could have devastating impacts on the Caribbean fishery.\nThe proposal received international criticism from fishermen, scientists, and politicians, demonstrating the perennial conflict between the global commercial fishing industry and those engaged in recreational, sport, or subsistence fishing. In 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) attempted to resolve this conflict by establishing fishery conservation measures. However, these measures are undermined by concepts such as maximum sustainable yield and optimum utilization, which prioritize the market value of a fishery’s resources over its recreational value. As the global commercial fishing industry begins to converge on one of the last fishing frontiers, the United States must shift how the world views fishery management. This article will discuss how stakeholders to the agreement can use both legal principles and non-legal incentives to induce the Bahamas to remain a sport fishing haven and support its artisanal fishing industry",

Its main purpose is to familiarize conservation professionals i.e., the managers and staff of government conservation agencies, international donors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with a menu of options for financing the conservation of marine and coastal biodiversity. A number of economic incentive mechanisms for marine conservation (as contrasted with revenue-raising mechanisms) are also presented in section 5 (on Real Estate and Development Rights) and section 6 (on Fishing Industry Revenues). Each section provides a description of the financing mechanism and examples showing how the mechanism has been used to finance marine conservation. In some cases, even though a mechanism may have only been used to finance terrestrial conservation, it has been included in this guide because of its potential to also serve as a new source of funding for marine conservation. This guide is not intended to provide detailed instructions on how to establish and implement each of the different conservation financing mechanisms. Instead references are provided at the end of each section for sources of additional information about each of the mechanisms described.

    "abstract": "This Paper traces the history of aquaculture from ancient China until the present, highlighting the various degrees of, and reasons for, aquaculture’s popularity at different points throughout history.  The history of aquaculture demonstrates that the industry is largely a manifestation of concern over environmental and economic costs of the capture fishery industry; yet the current practice of aquaculture has begun to resemble the tortured past of wild-caught fish, with mono-culture fish farms causing serious environmental and economic problems for inland and coastal human and natural environments.  Thus, this Paper argues that the history of the development of the aquaculture industry can serve as a cautionary tale as the industry moves forward, using the rubric of Garrett Hardin’s The Tragedy of the Commons to delineate the ways in which aquaculture succeeds and fails at achieving one of its fundamental purposes: to provide a sustainable method of protein provision to human society.  This Paper posits that aquaculture, historically viewed as a substitute for dwindling wild fish stocks, a solution to the exploitation of a global commons, should itself also be viewed as a contributor to serious tragedies of the commons by both exploitation and by pollution.  However, aquaculture has never been adequately regulated holistically as an instigator of environmental and economic problems.  Thus, for the aquaculture industry to realize its full, impressive potential as an environmentally beneficial, economically sound, and domestically responsible method of protein production, it must draw lessons from its history to become a sustainable, “green” blue revolution",

    "abstract": "The United Nations (UN) is in the process of launching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 aspirational goals, which replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), seek to alleviate poverty and promote sustainable development from 2016 to 2030. Under the proposed SDG framework there is a stand-alone goal on oceans. This Ocean SDG along with many other SDGs has numerous implications for the ocean business community. This analysis assesses the potential opportunities and risks for ocean industry involvement with the SDGs. It identifies which goals are relevant to the ocean business community, evaluates which ocean industry sectors will be most affected, and provides suggestions for ocean business community involvement. To determine the opportunities and risks associated with the SDGs for ocean industries, this analysis was conducted in partnership with the World Ocean Council. The World Ocean Council is a consortium of ocean businesses that seeks to ensure “a healthy and productive global ocean and its sustainable use, development, and stewardship by a responsible ocean business community.”  It engages a wide range of ocean industries on issues spanning from ocean policy to marine spatial planning",

    "abstract": "This report looks at the proven benefits of marine parks for fish stocks (and therefore for the fishing industry), and estimates the value of ecosystem services provided by areas to be covered by the new marine parks.\nIt also puts the modest and short-term economic impacts of the new  marine reserves on the fishing industry in context, noting the need to  avoid the flaws in the Great Barrier Reef compensation package, and  looking at the advantages of designing compensation to support the  long-term profitability of commercial fishers in Australia.\nKey findings:\n•\tCPD’s analysis shows that the new National Marine Parks in the Proposed Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network cover an area that provides $1.2 billion a year in ecosystem service value that is not recognised in our economic accounts, bringing the total value of Australia’s fully-protected Marine Parks to $2 billion a year in ecosystem services.\n•\tCPD has estimated the value of ecosystem services covered by the fully-protected National Parks only. We have calculated the economic value provided by four categories of marine ecosystem: coral reefs, seagrasses, coastal shelf and open ocean. Each of these areas provides services of value such as nurseries for fish, carbon storage, etc.\n•\tAustralia can be very proud of having taken such a strong step to protect its marine resources. Preserving the marine environment will help to secure Australia’s marine economy, underpinning the long-term productivity of our marine estate.\n•\tThe Proposed Marine Reserves Network covers 36% of Australia’s marine territory. The fully- protected part, the National Marine Parks, cover 13% of the total. In the other 23% recreational fishing is allowed and some kinds of commercial fishing, varying by zoning. Most of the reserve restricts the most damaging forms of fishing including bottom trawling – this is likely to deliver long- term benefits for recreational fishers and commercial fishers using more sustainable practices.\n•\tThe National Marine Parks, areas closed to fishing, are an essential part of preserving marine ecosystems and marine life, including fishing for the longer term. Given the high economic value provided by coral reefs, seagrasses, and coastal shelf areas, more of these areas should have been included in marine parks under the Proposed Marine Reserves Network\n•\tMarine parks have been shown to have numerous benefits, leading to larger fish and more biodiversity. The parks make marine ecosystems more resilient to environmental shocks and act as restocking areas for the surrounding waters. Studies show that in the long run they provide benefits to fishers. Recent studies on marine parks in the Great Barrier Reef find that they are working as they are supposed to – rebuilding the biomass of local fish populations in ways that are likely to deliver long-term benefits to fishers.\n•\tThe Great Barrier Reef compensation package, which blew out to $250 million, would form a very poor precedent for compensating fishers who are displaced by the Marine Reserves Network. The Finance Minister at the time, Nick Minchin, thought that the Great Barrier Reef package was too large. Initial estimates of the value of fishing production displaced by the Great Barrier Reef rezoning were $14 million a year, but dropped to $3-$7 million after accounting for the fact that many fishers were able to shift to other areas. Initial estimates are that $11.1 million a year of commercial fishing production may be displaced by the newly announced Marine Reserves Network. $100 million, a figure flagged by Minister Tony Burke as available for compensation, would be a generous compensation package.\n•\tCompensation should be implemented along the lines of the ‘Securing our Fishing Future’ package to ease rather than displace long-term pressures on fish stocks and the profitability of the fishing industry",

    "abstract": "&nbsp; The Oceans Governance project was funded by the Emerging Issues  Programme, overseen by the Institute of Policy Studies at Victoria  University of Wellington. Its primary goal is to provide interested  members of the public and policymakers with a general overview and a  description of the types of principles, planning tools and policy  instruments that can be used to strengthen and improve marine governance  in New Zealand.&nbsp;The major findings of this study are that the  existing marine governance framework in New Zealand emphasises a  traditional sector-by-sector approach to management and planning and  that this fragmented governance framework contributes to a number of  institutional challenges. In addition, the study identifies a number of  factors that influence marine planning and decision-making in the  country, including but not limited to; the relationships between  economic use of marine resources and the maintenance of marine ecosystem  services and goods; Māori interests, perspectives and treaty  obligations; the role of international treaties and conventions; the  synergistic and cumulative impacts of multiple use and climate  disturbance on marine ecosystems, and the role of scientists and science  in marine planning and decision-making.The report makes two  general recommendations.&nbsp; First, with respect to the territorial sea  (which includes the marine area out to 12 nautical miles) the report  recommends that regional councils develop integrative marine plans where  conflict between users and users-ecosystems is likely to develop in the  future.&nbsp; Second, the report recommends the adoption of new role for  central government to support an ecosystem-based approach to integrative  marine planning and decision-making",

    "abstract": "The white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris is the most numerous cetacean after the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena in the North Sea, including Dutch coastal waters. In this study, the diet of 45 white-beaked dolphins stranded on the Dutch coast between 1968 and 2005 was determined by analysis of stomach contents. Although 25 fish species were identified, the diet was dominated by Gadidae (98.0% by weight, 40.0% in numbers), found in all stomachs. All other prey species combined contributed little to the diet by weight (2.0%W). The two most important prey species were whiting Merlangius merlangus (91.1% frequency of occurrence (FO), 30.5%N, 37.6%W) and cod Gadus morhua (73.3%FO, 7.4%N, 55.9%W). In numbers, gobies were most common (54.6%N), but contributed little to the diet by weight (0.6%W). Three stomachs contained different prey compared to the others: one animal had taken 2250 gobies, accounting for 96.4% of all gobies found; one animal had fed on 29 small sepiolids; and one animal had solely taken haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus. Squid and haddock were not found in any other stomach. The overall diet showed a lasting predominance of whiting and cod, without clear changes over time (35 years) or differences between sexes or size-classes of dolphins. This study adds to earlier published and unpublished data for Dutch coastal waters and agrees well with studies of white-beaked dolphins from other parts of the species’ range, in the North Sea and in Canadian waters, with Gadidae dominating the diet on both sides of the Atlantic",

    "abstract": "This handbook is a unique product. It is the first \"field guide\" to community-based fisheries management focused specifically on fisheries, such as those of the Northwest Atlantic, that are already highly regulated by governmental authorities, with licensing and other requirements that limit access and effort. While a variety of resource materials are available on community-based natural resource management, almost all of these are written by practitioners working in the South (developing countries) and rely on case studies and techniques that have been tested in less industrialized tropical fisheries. Therefore, this handbook is one of the few publications about community-based management in 'Northern' fisheries.The need for this handbook was identified by participants working on an initiative on the Atlantic coast of Canada, \"Turning the Tide: Communities Managing Fisheries Together\" (www.turningthetide.ca). Turning the Tide works for improved fisheries management through community-based approaches, and through cooperative efforts among aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities. To that end, it has brought together fishermen and their communities to share information and ideas on community-based management, through events such as community forums and study tours. Participants recognized the need for a handbook on community-based fisheries management that is relevant to their own fisheries and that can be used as a tool to provide information and support for practitioners, as well as to document current practices and insights obtained, and to promote and raise public awareness about community-based fisheries management. The stories and insights in the handbook are those of Turning the Tide participants and their allies from around the Atlantic Region – the Atlantic coast of Canada and the north-eastern North America-United States – who shared this information during Turning the Tide activities, and in individual and group interviews, and who reviewed the materials used in producing this handbook. The various tools and ideas explored here are currently being applied in the region, and so the handbook demonstrates how community-based approaches to fisheries management are working today",

It is a synthesis of innovative science, led by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), with many partners around the world. Through these efforts, they've gathered vast new datasets from both traditional and less likely sources.The work includes more than 35 novel and critically important maps that show how nature's value to people varies widely from place to place. They also illustrate nature's potential. These maps show that one can accurately quantify the value of marine resources. Further, by enumerating such values, one can encourage their protection or enhancement for the benefit of people all around the world. In summary, it clearly articulates not just that we need nature, but how much we need it, and where",

    "abstract": "The Hampton-Seabrook Estuary Habitat Restoration Compendium (HSEHRC) is a compilation of information on the historic and current distributions of salt marsh and sand dune habitats and diadromous fishes within the Hampton-Seabrook Estuary watershed. These habitats and species groups were selected due to the important ecological role they play within the watershed and with effective restoration and conservation efforts, will continue to play. Other ecologically important habitats and species, such as avifauna, shellfish and eelgrass beds, currently are or historically were present within the watershed. Shellfish and seagrass are recognized as important habitats within the Estuary, but were not included in the current report because a different analytical approach may be required for such dynamic and/or short-lived species. A recent report by the New Hampshire (NH) Audubon Society details modern bird use of the Hampton-Seabrook Estuary (McKinley and Hunt 2008). Restoration opportunities have been identified within the watershed by evaluating habitat loss and changes in land use over time. Restoration opportunities are not prioritized in order to allow the goals and objectives of each restoration practitioner to govern project selection. However, in accordance with an ecosystem-based approach to restoration, areas containing multi-habitat restoration opportunities are considered to be of the highest priority. Furthermore, restoration efforts should ensure processes critical for the support of restored components are maintained or reestablished. The goal of this report is to identify restoration opportunities within the watershed derived from data on habitat change. Many other factors exist that are important in the identification and selection of restoration projects, including water quality and non-point source pollution, water withdrawal, harbor maintenance, recreational impacts, human history, and socioeconomic factors, among others. Although information regarding these factors is not explicitly included in this analysis, these factors must be considered and addressed as they may limit the potential for success in specific restoration efforts We present a series of maps detailing changes in the extent of sand dune and salt marsh habitats over time, the current and historic distribution of seven diadromous fish species, and restoration opportunities within the Hampton-Seabrook Estuary and watershed. A narrative describes the methods used, the results of analyses and examples of prominent restoration projects. Each major section concludes with references used in the narrative and maps. The maps are available for viewing as portable document format (.pdf) files. For those with GIS capabilities, the ArcMap 9.2 project files, associated data files and metadata are included on the compact disc as well. The underlying concept and methods for the HSEHRC stem from a previous project conducted within the Great Bay Estuary, the Great Bay Estuary Restoration Compendium (Odell et al. 2006)",

    "abstract": "In the last 15 years new research findings have radically reshaped our understanding of human effects on ocean ecosystems. Here I describe five major shifts in perspective that reveal our impacts to be more severe and persistent than previously appreciated. Firstly, scientists have delved deep into the past and found that the global expansion of European nations across the planet caused the large-scale loss of marine megafauna. In the past century, expansion of industrial scale fishing has continued the process, massively reducing the biomass of exploited species. Secondly, once depleted we are finding that populations rarely rebound rapidly, contrary to a widespread belief in greater resilience of marine compared to terrestrial species. Thirdly, marine ecosystems are being shifted into alternative states that are less desirable from the human perspective and may be stable. It could be difficult, or impossible in some cases, to reverse impacts once inflicted. Fourthly, marine species are at risk of extinction. Loss of shallow water marine habitats is proceeding as rapidly as on land, many species have small geographic ranges, and many possess life history characteristics that leave them highly susceptible to overexploitation. Finally, the deep sea is not beyond harm. Depletion of shallow water fisheries and technological advances are opening up the deep to exploitation and its collateral impacts. If we are to reverse these negative trends we must establish large-scale networks of marine reserves that are off limits to damaging activities and fishing. Such reserves would protect biodiversity, and recover and sustain the world's fisheries productivity",

    "abstract": "Single species approaches to natural resource conservation and management are now viewed as antiquated and oversimplified for dealing with complex systems. Scientists and managers who work in estuaries and other marine systems have urged adoption of ecosystem based approaches to management for nearly a decade, yet practitioners are still struggling to translate the ideas into practice. Similarly, ecological restoration projects in coastal systems have typically addressed one species or habitat. In recent years, efforts to focus on multiple species and habitats have increased. Our project developed an integrated ecosystem approach to identify multi-habitat restoration opportunities in the Great Bay estuary, New Hampshire. We created a conceptual site selection model based on a comparison of historic and modern distribution and abundance data, current environmental conditions, and expert review. Restoration targets included oysters and softshell clams, salt marshes, eelgrass beds, and seven diadromous fish species. Spatial data showing the historical and present day distributions for multiple species and habitats were compiled and integrated into a geographic information system. A matrix of habitat interactions was developed to identify potential for synergy and subsequent restoration efficiency. Output from the site selection models was considered within this framework to identify ecosystem restoration landscapes. The final products of these efforts include a series of maps detailing multi-habitat restoration opportunities extending from upland freshwater fish habitat down to the bay bottom. A companion guidance document was created to present project methods and a review of restoration methods. The authors hope that this work will help to stimulate and inform new restoration projects within the Great Bay estuarine system, and that it will serve as a foundation to be updated and improved as more information is collected",

The first ever Global Symposium on Women in Fisheries, held in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on 29 November 2001 generated the present collection of papers on women in fisheries. The reader of this volume will find in it a wealth of information, albeit in a very heterogeneous form, that the authors have had to draw from many different sources. Some are primary research studies whereas most are historical reviews from first hand experience of the authors or derived from other written materials, often contained in reports of fisheries development projects, newspapers and source materials well outside the fish sectors.Women, Participation, Sustainability, Poverty, Fisheries, Development projects, Fishery technology",

The forum is open to all\n\ninterested parties, including policy makers, research scientists, government managers, and\n\nthose involved in the fishing industries. SAFARI organizes international workshops and\n\nsymposia as a platform to discuss the latest research in Earth observation and fisheries\n\nmanagement, information sessions aimed at the fisheries industry, government officials\n\nand resource managers, representation at policy meetings, and producing publications\n\nrelevant to the activities. SAFARI gains worldwide attention through collaboration\n\nwith other international networks, such as ChloroGIN (Chlorophyll Global Integrated\n\nNetwork), IOCCG (International Ocean-Colour Coordinating Group), POGO (Partnership\n\nfor Observation of the Global Oceans) and the oceans and society: Blue Planet Initiative\n\nof the intergovernmental organization, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO)",

Among other things, the studies aimed to document and explore the understanding that fishing communities have about their rights to fisheries and coastal resources, as well as the obligations and responsibilities associated with these rights, and to document and discuss their initiatives to assert these rights and fulfill their responsibilities. The studies formed the basis for discussions at the Workshop and Symposium. This case study from Cambodia will be found useful by NGOs, regional and national organizations of artisanal fishworkers, and anyone interested in fisheries and fishing communities in Cambodia",

The use of dispersants in response to that spill raised concerns regarding the need for chemical dispersants, the fate of the oil and dispersants, and their potential impacts on human health and the environment. Concerns remain that would be more evident in the Arctic, where the remoteness and harsh environmental conditions would make a response to any oil spill very difficult. An outcome of a 2013 Arctic oil spill exercise for senior federal agency leadership identified the need for an evaluation of the state-of-the-science of dispersants and dispersed oil (DDO), and a clear delineation of the associated uncertainties that remain, particularly as they apply to Arctic waters.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in partnership with the Coastal Response Research Center (CRRC), and in consultation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) embarked on a project to seek expert review and evaluation of the state-of-the-science and the uncertainties involving DDO. The project focused on five areas and how they might be affected by Arctic conditions: dispersant effectiveness, distribution and fate, transport and chemical behavior, environmental impacts, and public health and safety.

The workshop was a response to the FAO Committee on Fisheries' call for technical guidelines for marine protected areas (MPAs) to assist Members to establish representative networks of MPAs by 2012, as agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development. This paper focuses on three key themes. First, it highlights the commonalities between discussions of marine protected areas and of fisheries management, with emphasis on their mutual use of spatial measures and ecosystem approaches. Second, the paper draws on the other Background Papers prepared for the Workshop, as well as a range of additional literature, to produce a substantial compilation of issues and considerations relating to the development and implementation of MPAs, within a fisheries management context. The third key theme of the paper is a focus on the 'preliminary steps' of decision-making, in which scoping of needs, gaps and feasibility takes place from the dual perspectives of MPAs and fisheries management. A relative paucity of information and analysis on this topic is noted, along with a consequent need for additional work on the subject. An initial effort is undertaken to explore the key decision-making elements in this 'preliminary stage'",

A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis identified three priority transboundary problems that affect the CLME: unsustainable exploitation of fish and other living resources, the degradation and modification of natural habitats, pollution and contamination. The fourwing flyingfish fishery is the single most important small pelagic fishery in the southern Lesser Antilles. It is a shared resource, which has been traditionally exploited by seven different States, i.e. Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. With expanding fleet capacity and limited cooperation among the States exploiting the flyingfish, there is concern that the resource may become overfished. While the flyingfish fishery is a directed fishery, it is at the same time part of a multi-species, multi-gear fishery, which also targets regional large pelagic species.This case study identifies and analyses the priority transboundary problems and issues. The policy, legal and institutional reforms needed to address such transboundary issues and achieve long-term conservation and sustainable use of the resources are also identified. A major and necessary component of the case study is an evaluation of the existing policy cycles and linkages among the countries and institutions involved with the flyingfish fishery",

    "abstract": "Sri Lanka is an island country with a land area of 65 610 km2. With the declaration of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in 1976, the country gained sovereign rights over an ocean area of 536 000 km2 and EEZ extending from 24 to 200 nm. The continental shelf is about 26 000 km2 with an average width of around 22 km, and the coastline is 1 100 km long. The total annual fish production of Sri Lanka was 25 000 t in 1952 and 269 850 t in 1998. Major fish species caught in Sri Lankan waters are skipjack, blood fish, yellow fin tuna, mullet, shark, trevally, Spanish mackerel, prawns, lobsters. Gross domestic product (GDP) is composed of services, agriculture including forestry and fishery, manufacturing, construction and mining and quarrying. Of these, the agriculture sector contributed 21% with 2.5% coming from the fisheries subsector in 1998. In 1975, fisheries contributed Rs420 million to GDP and substantially improved to Rs24 823 million (US$382 million at 1 US$ = 64.90 Sri Lanka Rupee; source: oanda.com) in 1998. Export volume from fisheries was 3 240 t in 1985, and 11 433 t in 1998; equivalent to an export value of Rs453 mil (US$7 million) to Rs6 732 mil. (US$104 million). The fisheries sector has provided direct employment opportunities to over 115 000 people and indirect benefits to 100 000 people in related occupations such as fish processing, boat building and other equipment manufacture and trade and public sector organizations. A socioeconomic survey conducted in 1996 noted a fisher population of 83 776 with 81.7% having fishing as their sole source of income, 12.5% as their main source and 4.3% as their second source. Fish is the main and preferred source of animal protein in Sri Lanka. Fish consumption accounts for 5% of the total food consumption and per capita fish consumption was 12.77 kg in 1998. However fish constitutes a substantial share of expenditure on food because of its high domestic price. The policy of almost all fisheries projects in Sri Lanka has been to maximize the fisheries resource utilization for direct extractive purposes rather than for sustainable resource management. This short-range orientation has increased the efficiency of fishing operations through the application of advanced technologies in fish capture, leading to a shift from the traditional fishing methods to the adoption of modern fishing gear. This has led to the depletion of fishery resources, particularly in the coastal waters. Thus there is a need to adopt programmes that emphasize the development of offshore fishing and thereby reduce fishing pressure in the coastal areas. Implementation of alternative livelihood opportunities would also improve the quality of life of coastal fishers.Fishery resources, Fishery surveys, Catch/effort, Trawling, Population characteristics, Biomass, Coastal fisheries, Mathematical models, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Socioeconomic aspects, Artisanal fishing, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, ISW, Sri Lanka,",

    "abstract": "Sri Lanka being an island is blessed by nature with ideal environmental factors on the field of agriculture which is being intentionally practiced towards the sustainability. The agriculture sector in Sri Lanka always acts as a major economic strength to the national economy as it ensures the food security, employment and poverty alleviation of rural communities. The sector is mainly driven by variety of distinct sub sectors which include crop cultivations such as paddy, tea, rubber, coconut, vegetables, fruits, export crops and sugar while in addition livestock and fisheries sectors also provide a substantial contribution simultaneously. Negative and positive fluctuations of each above mentioned subsector directly affects on the overall country uplift and the society wellbeing. This paper will be discussing about the present status of the agriculture in Sri Lanka in a concise manner with respect to the recently published official data by country regulatory bodies",

While recent research programs employing advanced scientific techniques have been implemented, significant knowledge gaps persist. A comprehensive approach is needed to synthesize the archaeological past from prehistoric times to the recent colonial period. This review highlights some research questions emerging from previous studies advocating for further exploration. Since the MJS possesses an intertwined history with its coastal settings and resources, this article’s main focus is on understudied sites and periods to enhance the knowledge on coastal archaeological studies of Sri Lanka. Revisiting overlooked publications and addressing challenges such as data management and research integrity are crucial to gaining a more complete understanding of this region\\u27s complex past. This comprehensive compilation encompasses all known works on the MJS, serving as an essential resource for future researchers to build upon",

    "abstract": "1Blue whale locations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303 239), sightings (4383 records of =8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings.2Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14 676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65.2%) or pairs (24.6%); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. Sighting rates (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest in the waters of Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar.3Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering.4Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic (‘true’) subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic.5Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. Sighting rates are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales.6South-east Pacific blue whales have a discrete distribution and high sighting rates compared with the Antarctic. Further work is needed to clarify their subspecific status given their distinctive genetics, acoustics and length frequencies.7Antarctic blue whales numbered 1700 (95% Bayesian interval 860–2900) in 1996 (less than 1% of original levels), but are increasing at 7.3% per annum (95% Bayesian interval 1.4–11.6%). The status of other populations in the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean is unknown because few abundance estimates are available, but higher recent sighting rates suggest that they are less depleted than Antarctic blue whales.</li",

    "abstract": "The Gulf of Mannar (GoM) located along the south eastern tip of India falls in the Indo-Pacific realm\n\nand is one of the richest regions in the world from a marine biodiversity perspective. The region has a\n\ndistinctive socio-economic and cultural profile shaped by its geography. It has an ancient maritime history\n\nand was famous for the production of pearls, an important item in trade with the Roman Empire as early as\n\nthe first century AD. Rameshwaram along the GoM with its links to the legend Ramayana is an important\n\npilgrim centre. The region has been and continues to be famous for its production of Indian sacred chanks.\n\nIt has unique ecosystems mainly consisting of coral reefs, sea grass beds, salt marshes and mangroves\n\nwhich constitute important habitats for many species of commercially important finfishes and shellfishes.\n\nThe GoM was established as a Biosphere Reserve (the first marine biosphere reserve in south and south\n\neast Asia) by 1989 by the Indian Government and the state of Tamil Nadu. A biosphere reserve is an area\n\nthat is indented to secure the fundamental diversity of life in a region while continuing to advocate in\n\neconomic growth. The overall objective of this Marine Biosphere Reserve is to conserve the Gulf of Mannar's\n\nglobally significant assemblage of coastal and marine biodiversity and to integrate biodiversity\n\nconservation into coastal zone management plans. Thus, the GoM in addition to being a national priority\n\nalso assumes global significance",

Following surface surveys, test pits were excavated in three pearl oyster middens and one coastal settlement. The archaeomalacological study of the molluscan remains from the middens confirms that the pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata) was the predominant species exploited, providing a clear picture of the pearl oyster bank ecosystems used at the industrial level. Morphometric analysis of the pearl oysters allows for an assessment of exploitation pressure. Ceramic and radiocarbon analyses date the high impact of the pearl industry from the tenth to the nineteenth centuries. The study of by-catch fauna provides insight into pearl bank ecosystems over time. These archaeological findings highlight the impact of industrial extractions on a single species.</p",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\nThe Fishing industry play a major role in socio-economic context of Sri Lanka. Even though, there is a significant potential to develop the fishing industry in country, the current economic performances of the industry are not satisfactory due to poor management mechanisms. It is essential to implement sustainable management approaches in order to achieve socio-economic and environmental sustainability. The analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of fishery resources is an important step toward sustaining the resources. However, acquiring data about the distribution and spatiotemporal allocation of catch and fishing efforts in commercial marine fisheries remains challenging. This study aims to investigate the distribution pattern of the longline tuna fishery and identify sustainable fishing grounds in Sri Lanka. The study uses the fisheries data from VMS and logbook between 2015 until 2019, obtained from the Department of fisheries and aquatic resources. The socio-economic data were collected from thirty multiday boat fishermen covering the south, west and east coasts using a semi-structured questionnaire. The study is based on Geographic Information System (GIS) and descriptive statistical analysis. \r\nThe results of the GIS-based analysis show high variations in catch and catch per trip distribution patterns by years and seasons. Hotspots of fishing efforts, catches (quantity) and catch per trips (CPT) were identified. The results show the areas of clusters with high CPT values increased slightly after 2016. The hotspots map show that there is strong seasonal influences in the concentration of fishing efforts and catches. The socio-economic results confirm that Sri Lankan longline fishers predominantly use traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to determine their potential fishing zone. Natural signs such as birds, floating, group information, and extreme oceanographic conditions such as waves, wind, and currents were the main factors that longline fishers use to decide where they will go fishing. The effective visualization and communication of identified and mapped seasonal, and annual as well as persistent and sustainable fishing grounds maps to stakeholders and managers may provide a great opportunity to sustainable management of fisheries in Sri Lanka. Moreover, the study shows the importance of integrating TEK to understand the fishers behavior in space and time and to support sustainable management of the fishery system",

With this declaration she extended her jurisdiction over a 500,000 km of sea area as a coastal state.  The acquisition of this vast sea area enables Sri Lanka to provide the most needed animal protein requirement of her population by harnessing the fishery resources available in the EEZ.  This paper reviews the impact of the declaration of the Exclusive Economic Zone on the offshore and deep sea fish production in Sri Lanka from 1977 to 1990 especially in relation to expectations and capabilities of harnessing the offshore and deep sea resources.  The review also includes a discussion of the impacts of permitting foreign fishing to harness these resources and some proposals to be considered for future development of the offshore and deep sea fishery in Sri Lanka",

The project aimed at providing a critical understanding of changes taken place amongthe fishing communities in these countries within the context of depleting natural resources, social conflicts, climate change,technological changes and policy changes. The main aim of this article is to review and discuss current policy initiatives in fisheriesin Cambodia, India and Sri Lanka to examine their transformative potential in addressing the issues of poverty and well-being among fishing communities. Using content analysis method, this paper focuses on the 2010-2019 and 2015-2024 Strategic Planning Frameworks in Fisheries of Cambodia, 2017-fishery policy in India and 2018-fishery policy in Sri Lanka to understand their transformative potentials. The analysis finds that the selected policies show tremendous transformative potentials in the areas of reducing poverty and improving the well-being of SSFs. Yet their capacity to make such transformation remains unclear. It calls for a comprehensive policy approach to address the issues of smallscale fishers who are the backbone of the fisheries livelihoods.\nDOI : http://doi.org/10.31357/fhss/vjhss.v06i02.0",

    "abstract": "The geo-strategic location of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, which is a part of global and regional power competition, is close to the key and busy naval routes between the East and the West. Particularly, the marine area of Sri Lanka has critical geopolitical importance due to its location between the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca, which are essential transit zones in the world. The marine area of Sri Lanka has gained much attention from the industrial and newly industrial nations due to the living and non-living natural resources contained in the surrounding sea. With this background note, this paper focuses on discussing the sea power dimension of national security, focusing on the case of Sri Lanka, which has been neglected by contemporary academia of small powers’ studies. For this purpose, Alfred Thayer Mahan’s theory on sea power has been employed to theoretically and practically examine the feasibility of its application for enhancing the sea power of Sri Lanka in the context of changing global order. The research was drawn from a wide range of secondary sources and a descriptive analysis was made. The paper concludes with implications for some realistic policies for enhancing the sea power capacity of Sri Lanka as it allows the free flow of people and goods as well as the projection of naval power of Sri Lanka",

    "abstract": "After Sri Lanka\\u27s independence in 1948, the economic importance of the coastal areas had intensified due to development of commercial and fishery harbors, transportation, communication, and recreational facilities.  Opportunities in the public administration, industry, and education sectors were other main attractions.  With the introduction of international tourism in 1970, economic development of coastal areas increased further.  In addition to the job opportunities provided by the industrial and commercial sectors, many people were engaged in other activities depending on coastal resources, including fishing and mining activities.  Prior to 1978, there was no proper authority or mechanism to address coastal issues.  legislation specifically adopted to deal with coastal problems did not exist in Sri Lanka until 1980.  The increasing coastal problems continued to occur with the degradation and exploitation of coastal resources.  Realizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to coastal management, the Sri Lanka government enacted the Coast Conservation Act (CCA) No. 57 in 1981.  The CCA required the establishment of the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) whose objective is to implement the national coastal management program",

    "abstract": "Transboundary fishing between India and Sri Lanka is one of many issues that leads to vulnerabilities (classified as domains and drivers of vulnerability in the present study) in the human and natural environments of small-scale fishing (SSF) communities in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this qualitative study aims to (i) identify the factors that contribute to the vulnerability of SSF communities in the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka, (ii) analyse how vulnerabilities impact SSF communities in the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka, and (iii) devise intervention strategies that mitigate vulnerabilities and promote sustainability within SSF communities in Sri Lanka. A total of 25 respondents were involved in this study, including leaders of fisheries cooperative societies and other stakeholders in the SSF sector in the Jaffna peninsula. Primary data was collected through key informant interviews and focus group discussions and analysed following reflexive thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti software. The data analysis first identified multidimensional vulnerabilities deduced into 15 vulnerability drivers in five domains. The analysis found a new vulnerability domain in the Sri Lanka-specific context, i.e., the impacts of civil war and post-war torments. Analysis of the second objective suggests that all identified vulnerability drivers critically challenge the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of the SSF communitie",

Progress in Oceanography, 182, (2020): 102241, doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2019.102241.In addition to being an esteemed marine ecologist and oceanographer, William T. (Bill) Peterson was a dedicated public servant, a leader in the ocean science community, and a mentor to a generation of scientists. Bill recognized the importance of applied science and the need for integrated “big science” programs to advance our understanding of ecosystems and to guide their management. As the first US GLOBEC program manager, he was pivotal in transitioning the concept of understanding how climate change impacts marine ecosystems to an operational national research program. The scientific insight and knowledge generated by US GLOBEC informed and advanced the ecosystem-based management approaches now being implemented for fishery management in the US. Bill held significant leadership roles in numerous international efforts to understand global and regional ecological processes, and organized and chaired a number of influential scientific conferences and their proceedings. He was passionate about working with and training young researchers. Bill’s academic affiliations, notably at Stony Brook and Oregon State Universities, enabled him to advise, train, and mentor a host of students, post-doctoral researchers, and laboratory technicians. Under his collegial guidance they became critical independent thinkers and diligent investigators. His former students and colleagues carry on Bill Peterson’s legacy of research that helps us understand marine ecosystems and informs more effective resource stewardship and conservation",

    "abstract": "With regard to the ever-increasing need for energy in current societies to satisfy various requirements, scientists and researchers from different countries, such as Iran, have a basic approach in their agenda to achieve renewable energies، The scientists believe that with regard to the limited fossil fuels and their environmental pollutions, renewable and clean energies can be the first alternative to generate energy، Our country, Iran, has numerous capabilities in the field of generating new and renewable energies، This fact emphasizes the need for an optimum model to develop the use of renewable energies، In line with this objective the costfunction is chosenas the objective function، Given the potential and limits ofrenewable energy (resources Limited), Consumptionof electricpowerin each of16regions (apply Limited) confidencelimits  of renewable energy (technical limitations), the model was designed and with use Robust optimization model was solved in LINGO software،The optimum of using renewable energies suggests the 36،71% generation of small hydropower energy, 18،22% wind energy, 17،19% biomass energy, 13،43% geothermal energy, 12،53% tidal energy, and 1% solar energy. 2- Ciaschini, M et al (2011), “The Effects of Environmental Taxation Through a Dynamic CGE Model, Environmental Federalism: The Political Economy of the Design of Local Taxation and Environmental Protection”, Ancona, Italy, December 9-10, 2011   3- Devarajan, S.

BHM seeks to develop a Montserrat Sustainable Ocean Policy that will ensure long-term health of Montserrat's waters through ocean zoning, protected areas, and fisheries reforms. This Report is an evaluation of Montserrat's laws and institutions to support the design and implementation of a comprehensive ocean zoning and management system in the country as part of the Blue Halo Initiative. The Report identifies existing authorities to achieve a comprehensive ocean zoning system in the waters surrounding Montserrat, evaluates potential options for ocean planning and management implementation, and provides recommendations for ways to develop a comprehensive ocean management system for Montserrat. The Report recognizes that comprehensive ocean management should build from the existing legal system, take pragmatic steps given anticipated capacity and funding, and provide effective incentives and requirements to ensure compliance and long-term sustainability of ocean resources",

    "abstract": "The EU is a pre-eminent player in sustainable development, adopting more than 200 pieces of legislation that have direct repercussions for marine environmental policy and management. Over five decades, measures have aimed to protect the marine environment by tackling the impact of human activities, but maritime affairs have been dealt with by separate sectoral policies without fully integrating all relevant sectors. Such compartmentalisation has resulted in a patchwork of EU legislation and resultant national legislation leading to a piecemeal approach to marine protection. These are superimposed on international obligations emanating from UN and other bodies and are presented here as complex ‘horrendograms’ showing the complexity across vertical governance. These horrendograms have surprised marine experts despite them acknowledging the many uses and users of the marine environment. Encouragingly since 2000, the evolution in EU policy has progressed to more holistic directives and here we give an overview of this change",

    "abstract": "Examining fisheries, Brexit, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and its consequences for the Fishing Industry in the UK and the EU, this book explores key issues within the complex topic of fisheries after Brexit. Assessing the new fishing relationship between the UK and the EU, which will continue to develop over the next decade, it provides an important study of the state of fisheries post-Brexit. Taking a cross-cutting economic, legal and policy approach, the book outlines the social and economic impacts of Brexit on the UK and EU fishing industries. It critically analyses the provisions relevant to fisheries in the TCA, reflects on the bilateral fishing negotiations between the EU, UK and Norway, providing inferences as to what the \"new and special relationship\" might be in fisheries. It then focuses on the 2020 Fisheries Act and explores internal divergences in the nations of the UK because of devolution. Taking an international approach, the work offers an exploration of cooperation in fisheries enforcement, international and regional obligations in marine conservation, and the new horizons for the UK in international fisheries organizations and arrangements now it is no longer a member of the EU. It offers an overview of expert opinion on fisheries post-Brexit, highlighting lessons learned and future developments for fisheries in a post-Brexit world. Having finally signed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on 31 December 2020 after tense negotiations, the United Kingdom and European Union have found themselves in a new fisheries relationship. This book maps the complex social, economic, legal and policy issues of fisheries in a post-Brexit world and will be of interest to stakeholders and scholars",

    "abstract": "India’s marine fisheries are at a turning point; the rapid increase in yields witnessed\n\nduring the first 60 years of independence has slowed down and the scope for increase\n\nin yields from new unexploited and underexploited fish stocks and grounds seems\n\nlimited. The situation calls for urgent measures to sustain the production close to the\n\ntarget potential yield of 4.41 million tonnes. These measures would mean implementation\n\nof science based fisheries management and regulations. Although much has been\n\naccomplished by way of research and development in marine fisheries in India, the\n\ntransformation and implementation of the outcome of these studies into effective\n\nmanagement of marine fisheries resources of the country has been a shortcoming so\n\nfar. The FAO brought out the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO-CCRF)\n\nin 1995 to serve as a guidance for countries for a sound and effective management of\n\nfisheries resources. This FAO-CCRF has not been put into practice in India, althrough\n\nthere are some compliances.\n\nScientists of the CMFRI and CIFT, two of India’s major fisheries research institutes,\n\nhave come together to develop a guidance on how the code can be put into practice\n\nin the country. Aptly named as Indian Marine Fisheries Code (IMFC), it is expected to\n\ngive an impetus to bring about a sea change in the manner in which marine fisheries\n\nis managed in the country. The IMFC explains in detail each sub-article of the FAOCCRF\n\nand provides information on how the article can be implemented and by whom.\n\nThe IMFC further proposes several new bodies which are necessary to place fisheries\n\nmanagement in the country on an unassailable footing. It is expected that all fisheries\n\nmanagement bodies in the country, both at central and state levels would find the IMFC\n\nas a useful guidance for the future",

The four year, Spanish funded, FAO -Regional Fisheries Livelihoods Programme for South and Southeast Asia (RFLP) is working to strengthen the capacity among participating small-scale fishing communities and their supporting institutions in Cambodia, Asia (Southeastern)-Indonesia; the Asia (Southeastern)-Philippines; Asia (Southern)-Sri Lanka; Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. By doing so the RFLP is seeking to improve the livelihoods of fisher folk and their families while fostering more sustainable fisheries resources management practices. RFLP is seeking to put in place mechanisms and capacity for joint management of fisheries between the fishers and government authorities. National policies and legislation (local regulations) are being amended; registration of fishing boats have been either introduced and/or improved; stakeholder organizations have been formed and strengthened; officials and community members have been trained in co-management; fisheries management plans have been developed and implemented; there has been improvements in habitat management practices; and there have been participatory enforcement mechanisms put in place, among other actions. The purpose of the workshop is to facilitate regional sharing of information and experience (RFLP Output 6) with regards to RFLP co-management interventions (RFLP Output 1)",

    "abstract": "This publication provides guidance on how to implement the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) using an ecosystem approach to fisheries and aquaculture. The CCRF is a voluntary code covering all aspects of the management and development of fisheries and is designed to ensure sustainable development without adversely affecting the livelihoods of local communities that share the same resources as the fisheries. The authors outline the basic principles of the CCRF, describe concrete steps to be taken to use the ecosystem approach effectively, and recommend certain institutional changes and reforms that will be necessary if the potential of the ecosystem approach is to be realized in the Asia-Pacific region. The most significant reform needed is a paradigm shift in policy from one that is production oriented to one that is benefits oriented (social and economic). There is evidence that this is already being undertaken in the region with efforts being made to limit access, reduce the number of fishing vessels and introduce community-based rights systems. Stakeholder participation is essential and existing legal instruments and practices that interact with or impact fisheries may also need to be reconsidered, and adjustments made where necessary. In the future, it may even be necessary to regulate the inter-sectoral interactions and impacts through primary legislation. To promote broader adoption and implementation of the ecosystem approach by member countries, a wide range of regional activities is suggested by the authors including a media campaign, the building of fishery alliances among countries and capacity building in fishery agencies",

The paper examines the policy and legislative frameworks for co-management in thirteen countries in Asia and the Pacific, and the extent to which these frameworks hinder or support co-management practices. Through an analysis of the different case studies, 'lessons learned' are presented and a number of conclusions are drawn about the key characteristics of a supportive policy and legislative framework based on some ideas about 'best practice'. The adoption of these characteristics by governments would demonstrate their commitment to co-management and increase the likelihood of co-management success",

    "abstract": "Thailand is currently one of the ten largest fishing nations in the world. In 1996, fish production reached 3.7 million t with 90% of the production coming from the marine fisheries sector and 10% from inland fisheries. Thai fishing operates in four fishing grounds namely, the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea, the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal. However with the establishment of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1977, Thailand lost over 300 000 km2 of traditional fishing grounds. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand was estimated at 4 598 billion Baht (US$ 181 billion at 1 US$ = 25.36 Baht) in 1996 with 87.8 billion Baht (US$3.46 billion) (1.9%) coming from the fish industry. In 1997, fishery product exports reached 138 624 million Baht (US$4 million at 1 US$ = 31.18 Baht) or 69% (200 795 million Baht including fish) of the total agriculture exports and 7.3% (1 898 276 million Baht) of total exports. However, the rapid growth of manufacturing and service sectors has diminished the contribution of the fisheries sector to GDP in the recent years. Of the estimated 35.6 million labor force in Thailand in 1998, 43% were employed in the agricultural sector including fisheries. The 1995 Census of Marine Fishery showed that the total number of fishery households including fisheries employeesÃ† households in the country was 109 635. No census was conducted for inland fisheries. The fisheries sector also supports a substantial level of employment in industries like fish processing, cold storage, fishmeal, ice making, boat construction and the like. The labor force of these industries was estimated to be at 211 682 in 1995. Fish is the primary source of animal protein for most of ThailandÃ†s population, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal provinces. The average per capita fish consumption is 24 kg annually. Marine capture fisheries can be broadly divided into commercial and small scale sub-sectors. Commercial vessels are those vessels over 10 m in length or 5 GT, that use modern fishing gear and have the capacity to fish offshore for several days. Small scale vessels are usually less than 10 m in length and either employ outboard- or inboard-engines, or are non-motorized and operate in near shore areas. From 1985 to 1995, the number of small scale fishing boats increased by 7.5%, while the commercial boats increased by 11%. One reason for the change has been the creation of a boat-tenure system within the commercial fishing sector, resulting in a decrease in the number of boats per household. The major fishing gear used by the small scale fishers are gillnets, small push nets, lift nets or other modern small scale gear, set traps, bagnets and other stationary gear in estuaries or protected inshore waters. In the fishing household of Songhkla Province, Southern Thailand, shrimp gillnets, cuttlefish trammel nets, Indo-Pacific mackerel gillnets, other gillnets and Acetes trawl nets are the major fishing gear. The fishers direct their effort towards high value species like shrimp, cuttlefish, pomfret fish and crabs, but they also obtain by-catch low value fish species. The most important determinant of profit for small scale fisheries is the interaction between types of gear and fishing ground. Commercial fishing vessels utilize otter trawls, pair trawls, beam trawls, push nets, purse seines and king mackerel gillnets as the major fishing gear. The analysis of investment, cost, revenue and return on demersal and pelagic fishing operations shows that (a) returns differ markedly among size of fishing boats and types of fishing gear; (b) ability to generate profit is greater in large fishing boats than small due to their higher ability to adjust to both economic (investment) and biological (fishing ground) changes; and (c) among the trawlers, medium and large boats can best adapt to maintain continuous profit, while for push nets, all size of boats show declining net profit. In pelagic fishing operations, purse seiners have been developed to make high profits and yield a higher return than trawlers and gillnet fishing operations. The Schaefer Model was applied to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and maximum economic yield (MEY) for demersal fish and trash fish in the Gulf of Thailand. Results indicated that the present catch and the corresponding effort of demersal fishing in the Gulf of Thailand surpassed both MEY and MSY. In order to obtain the maximum net benefit in the long run, the present fishing effort of catching demersal fish must be reduced to about 50% of present levels. This would lead to the rehabilitation of marine resources and minimize the by-catch.Fishery resources, Fishery surveys, Catch/effort, Trawling, Population characteristics, Biomass, Coastal fisheries, Mathematical models, Marine fisheries, Ecosystems, Socioeconomic aspects, Artisanal fishing, Economic benefits, Fishery industry, Capture fishery economics, Fish consumption, ISEW, Thailand,",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of the coastal zone of Cameroon to flooding from sea level rise (SLR) was\n\nquantified using Geographic Information System (GIS) flooding analysis. The main economic\n\nactivities and ecosystems along this area were iden\n\ntified using secondary data. Valuations of non-\n\nmarket values of ecosystems were based on the ecosystem service product method. The low-lying\n\ncoastal areas were found to be\n\nphysically and socio-economically\n\nsusceptible to impacts of SLR\n\ndue to their high ecological and economic value. A digitised land use/land cover (LULC)\n\nclassification was produced from low resolution topographic maps and Google Earth images of the\n\narea. The digital elevation model (DEM) used\n\nwas acquired by the shuttle radar topography\n\nmission. Evaluation of potential land loss due to inundation was based on empirical approaches\n\nusing minimum and maximum scenarios of 2 and 10 m flooding. These were estimated considering\n\nthe best available SLR data for the area, mean high water levels and wave heights during storms.\n\nThe estimated SLR range from 2.3 m to 9.2 m for the\n\nlow and high scenarios, respectively, by 2050\n\nand from 2.6 m to 9.7 m for the low and high scenarios, respectively, by the year 2100. Results\n\nindicate that 112 km\n\n2\n\n(1.2 %) and 1,216 km\n\n2\n\n(12.6 %) of the coastal area will be lost from a 2 m\n\n(equivalent to a low scenario by 2050) and 10 m (equivalent to a high scenario by 2100) flooding,\n\nrespectively. 0.3 % to 6.3 % of ecosystems worth US$ 12.13 billion/yr\n\ncould be at risk of flooding\n\nby the years 2050 and 2100. The\n\nareas under a serious threat cont\n\nain mangroves, sea and airport,\n\nresidential and industrial areas of Douala. Main plantation crops of banana and palms will be\n\nslightly affected. The identification of the soci\n\no-economic impacts of projected SLR on vulnerable\n\ncoastlines and populations is important for timely actions to be taken in mitigating the effects of\n\nnatural disasters in the coastal zone",

    "abstract": "Executive Summary:\n\n\n\nThe EcoGIS project was launched in September 2004 to investigate how Geographic Information Systems (GIS), marine data, and custom analysis tools can better enable fisheries scientists and managers to adopt Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management (EAFM). EcoGIS is a collaborative effort between NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and four regional Fishery Management Councils.\n\n\n\nThe project has focused on four priority areas: Fishing Catch and Effort Analysis, Area Characterization, Bycatch Analysis, and Habitat Interactions. Of these four functional areas, the project team first focused on developing a working prototype for catch and effort analysis: the Fishery Mapper Tool. This ArcGIS extension creates time-and-area summarized maps of fishing catch and effort from logbook, observer, or fishery-independent survey data sets. Source data may come from Oracle, Microsoft Access, or other file formats. Feedback from beta-testers of the Fishery Mapper was used to debug the prototype, enhance performance, and add features.\n\n\n\nThis report describes the four priority functional areas, the development of the Fishery Mapper tool, and several themes that emerged through the parallel evolution of the EcoGIS project, the concept and implementation of the broader field of Ecosystem Approaches to Management (EAM), data management practices, and other EAM toolsets. In addition, a set of six succinct recommendations are proposed on page 29.\n\n\n\nOne major conclusion from this work is that there is no single “super-tool” to enable Ecosystem Approaches to Management; as such, tools should be developed for specific purposes with attention given to interoperability and automation. Future work should be coordinated with other GIS development projects in order to provide “value added” and minimize duplication of efforts.\n\n\n\nIn addition to custom tools, the development of cross-cutting Regional Ecosystem Spatial Databases will enable access to quality data to support the analyses required by EAM. GIS tools will be useful in developing Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs) and providing pre- and post-processing capabilities for spatially-explicit ecosystem models.\n\n\n\nContinued funding will enable the EcoGIS project to develop GIS tools that are immediately applicable to today’s needs. These tools will enable simplified and efficient data query, the ability to visualize data over time, and ways to synthesize multidimensional data from diverse sources. These capabilities will provide new information for analyzing issues from an ecosystem perspective, which will ultimately result in better understanding of fisheries and better support for decision-making.

One goal is to ensure that data from different and diverse in-situ observing Networks are readily accessible and useable to a wider community, including the international ocean science community and other stakeholders in this field. To achieve that, the strategy is to move towards an integrated data system within AtlantOS that harmonizes work flows, data processing and distribution across in-situ observing network systems, and integrates in-situ observations into existing European and international data infrastructures, termed Integrators (e.g. Copernicus INS TAC, SeaDataNet NODCs, EMODnet, EurOBIS, GEOSS).\n\nThis handbook aims to help the Networks to implement recommendations agreed upon within AtlantOS WP7 to achieve a better integration of their data, and to provide best practices guidelines for both Networks and Integrators for enhanced services to users.\n\nFirst it presents the roadmap for the AtlantOS integrated system and its actors, both Networks and Integrators.\n\nThen the elements of (1) standardization across the Networks relying on existing European and international standards and protocols, and of (2) of the data exchange backbone of the AtlantOS system, are described with the guidelines on how to set them up.\n\nFinally this handbook describes ways to facilitate data discovery at the Network level and enhancements at the Integrator level for better fit-for-purpose services to user",

    "abstract": "This report presents the first-ever detailed, map-based assessment of potential threats to coral reef ecosystems around the world. \"Reefs at Risk\" draws on 14 data sets (including maps of land cover, ports, settle-ments, and shipping lanes), information on 800 sites known to be degraded by people, and scientific expertise to model areas where reef degradation is predicted to occur, given existing human pressures on these areas. Results are an indicator of potential threat (risk), not a measure of actual condition. In some places, particularly where good management is practiced, reefs may be at risk but remain relatively healthy. In others, this indicator underestimates the degree to which reefs are threatened and degraded.Our results indicate that:Fifty-eight percent of the world's reefs are poten-tially threatened by human activity -- ranging from coastal development and destructive fishing practices to overexploitation of resources, marine pollution, and runoff from inland deforestation and farming.Coral reefs of Asia (Southeastern); the most species-rich on earth, are the most threatened of any region. More than 80 percent are at risk (undermedium and high potential threat), and over half are at high risk, primarily from coastal development and fishing-related pressures.Overexploitation and coastal development pose the greatest potential threat of the four risk categories considered in this study. Each, individually, affects a third of all reefs.The Pacific, which houses more reef area than any other region, is also the least threatened. About 60 percent of reefs here are at low risk.Outside of the Pacific, 70 percent of all reefs are at risk.At least 11 percent of the world's coral reefs contain high levels of reef fish biodiversity and are under high threat from human activities. These \"hot spot\" areas include almost all Philippine reefs, and coral communities off the coasts of Asia, the Comoros, and the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean.Almost half a billion people -- 8 percent of the total global population -- live within 100 kilometers of a coral reef.Globally, more than 400 marine parks, sanctuaries, and reserves (marine protected areas) contain coral reefs. Most of these sites are very small -- more than 150 are under one square kilometer in size. At least 40 countries lack any marine protected areas for conserving their coral reef systems",

    "abstract": "On June 7 and 8, 2017, the Coastal Response Research Center (CRRC)[1], NOAA Office of Response and Restoration (ORR) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Restoration Center (RC), co-sponsored the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWH) Long Term Data Management (LTDM) workshop at the ORR Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Disaster Response Center (DRC) in Mobile, AL.\nThere has been a focus on restoration planning, implementation and monitoring of the on-going DWH-related research in the wake of the DWH Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) settlement. This means that data management, accessibility, and distribution must be coordinated among various federal, state, local, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic, and private sector partners. The scope of DWH far exceeded any other spill in the U.S. with an immense amount of data (e.g., 100,000 environmental samples, 15 million publically available records) gathered during the response and damage assessment phases of the incident as well as data that continues to be produced from research and restoration efforts. The challenge with the influx in data is checking the quality, documenting data collection, storing data, integrating it into useful products, managing it and archiving it for long term use. In addition, data must be available to the public in an easily queried and accessible format. Answering questions regarding the success of the restoration efforts will be based on data generated for years to come. The data sets must be readily comparable, representative and complete; be collected using cross-cutting field protocols; be as interoperable as possible; meet standards for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC); and be unhindered by conflicting or ambiguous terminology.\nDuring the data management process for the NOAA Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) for the DWH disaster, NOAA developed a data management warehouse and visualization system that will be used as a long term repository for accessing/archiving NRDA injury assessment data. This serves as a foundation for the restoration project planning and monitoring data for the next 15 or more years. The main impetus for this workshop was to facilitate public access to the DWH data collected and managed by all entities by developing linkages to or data exchanges among applicable GOM data management systems.\nThere were 66 workshop participants (Appendix A) representing a variety of organizations who met at NOAA’s GOM Disaster Response Center (DRC) in order to determine the characteristics of a successful common operating picture for DWH data, to understand the systems that are currently in place to manage DWH data, and make the DWH data interoperable between data generators, users and managers. The external partners for these efforts include, but are not limited to the: RESTORE Council, Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI), Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative Information and Data Cooperative (GRIIDC), the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Gulf Research Program, Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA), and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF).\nThe workshop objectives were to:   Foster collaboration among the GOM partners with respect to data management and integration for restoration planning, implementation and monitoring;   Identify standards, protocols and guidance for LTDM being used by these partners for DWH NRDA, restoration, and public health efforts; Obtain feedback and identify next steps for the work completed by the Environmental Disasters Data Management (EDDM) Working Groups; and Work towards best practices on public distribution and access of this data. \nThe workshop consisted of plenary presentations and breakout sessions. The workshop agenda (Appendix B) was developed by the organizing committee. The workshop presentations topics included: results of a pre-workshop survey, an overview of data generation, the uses of DWH long term data, an overview of LTDM, an overview of existing LTDM systems, an overview of data management standards/ protocols, results from the EDDM working groups, flow diagrams of existing data management systems, and a vision on managing big data.\nThe breakout sessions included discussions of: issues/concerns for data stakeholders (e.g., data users, generators, managers), interoperability, ease of discovery/searchability, data access, data synthesis, data usability, and metadata/data documentation.\n[1] A list of acronyms is provided on Page 1 of this report",

    "abstract": "Satellite applications are being used in land, sea, air and space studies and management applications in the sea covering a wide spectrum of fields, such as oceanography (bathymetry, tides, waves, sea level, currents, surface water temperature), fisheries (resources distribution and monitoring of fisheries), shipping (fleet monitoring, communication, safety and rescue, pollution detection and monitoring), and navy (security, strategy, safety). Further, satellites can be used in the process of educating people onboard. The present research is a study of three satellite applications for Ocean and Coastal Zone Management (OCZM). Radar sensors which are used in bathymetric exploration are useful in the oil pipeline industry and in coastal navigation. Thermal and radar imaging have been used to detect indirectly the resource distribution of the tuna fisheries and lately also other fisheries. The Global Position System (GPS) and data communications today permit fleet monitoring, although the focus of this dissertation is on the fishing fleet. The development of any fleet monitoring system can follow the same principle. An interesting point is the cost — although this technology may appear expensive, it is in effect not. One of the objectives of this dissertation is to compare the value of traditional methods and satellite applications. With this I intend to give a new perspective of the capabilities of the new technology and its application in developing countries. The Ocean and Coastal Zone (OCZ) is a very wide area. Normally, the control and monitoring of this would take days, if traditional systems are used, and all analyses would be post-facto. Satellites can provide a wide variety of applications besides data communications technology. They can send position, type of vessel, speed, and other parameters in near-real time and therefore the ability of OCZM can be substantially increased. Herein lies the interest in exploring the employment of satellites as OCZ management tools. The methodology followed in the development of this paper is to conduct an analysis of remote sensing capabilities. This includes comparing remote sensing images and data with traditional methods of obtaining and analysing data for the management of the natural resources within the coastal and ocean areas of a country. In addition, Internet capabilities and library resources have been used extensively to research the arena of satellite science",

    "abstract": "Ice-bound, wild and remote, the Weddell Sea is a large, deep embayment nestled between the Antarctic Peninsula and Cape Norvegia. Lying south of the Atlantic Ocean, it is one of the most intact ecosystems in the world.At its widest, it is 2,000 km across, with the whole region encompassing 3.4 million km. The Weddell Sea has often been inaccessible to humans, but as research has increased over the past few decades, a picture has emerged of a vibrant marine ecosystem sustained by a combination of currents, seafloor features and ice.This research has revealed incredible biodiversity, particularly on the seafloor, with dozens of new species discovered on recent sampling expeditions. There are many more species yet to be discovered. Several species of whales and dolphins and six species of seals are found in the Weddell Sea, as well as a diversity of fish and seabirds. Even at depths of 6,000 metres, life has been found, underscoring the incredible diversity of life in the region. Nutrient rich currents interact with seafloor features, sea ice and ice shelves in a complex system that results in hotspots of plankton growth on the surface, supporting life from the surface to the ocean depths. The complexity of the Weddell Sea's region's undersea landscape enhances the diversity of life under the waves and ice by creating varied habitats for different undersea animals.The enormous richness of life generated by these interactions supports many seabird and mammal species including emperor penguins, Weddell, crab eater, and elephant seals as well as minke, humpback, blue, and fin whales. These animals come to feed on krill and silverfish, found in the many areas of high phytoplankton production (also known as \"primary productivity\") throughout the region. Yet climate change is having major impacts on the region with disruption to the icy environment. Changes in sea ice could be devastating for many species whose life cycle depends on pack ice. Protecting the unique, ecologically intact, and diverse deep-water regions of the Weddell Sea in a system of large-scale marine reserves and MPAs would ensure that its rich benthic biodiversity, krill populations, and large predators (including whales) continue to thrive",

    "abstract": "On the 10th of October 2010 the governmental entity known as the Netherlands Antilles is scheduled to cease to exist. Each island will aquire a new status within the kingdom. Following the declaration of an Exclusive Fishery Zone (EFZ) in 1993, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) has been declared in the Dutch Caribbean on the tenth of June 2010. The EEZ area concerned, is a large expanse of sea which harbours exceptional biodiversity, and represents an important natural renewable resource potential. The Netherlands Antilles, Aruba and The Netherlands have, therefore, opted to draft a management plan for the EEZ. This initiative began in the year 2005 when the first conference regarding the management of the biodiversity in the EEZ was held. The consensus was that despite a fragmented Dutch Caribbean, the EEZ should always be integrally managed. In 2009 the participants of the second conference confirmed the need for common management and developed common goals, principles and a framework for the management of the Dutch Caribbean waters. Resulting from this conference a management plan was drafted, circulated to all stakeholders and discussed on the 1st of June 2010. Based on the input and feedback received, as well as subsequent correspondence, this final management plan was jointly developed",

    "abstract": "The book tells the story of the sea-land continuum based on the case of the North Sea — one of the world’s most industrialised seas, in which the Netherlands plays a central role. The space of the North Sea is almost fully planned and has been loaded with the task of increased economic production from new and traditional maritime sectors. At the same time, it has been emptied of cultural signi ficance.\nThrough diverse projects from academia, art, literature, and practice, from analysis to design, the book explores synergies for designing this new spatial realm. Port city expert Carola Hein, professor of the history of architecture &amp; urban planning at Delft University of Technology, and Nancy Couling, associate professor at the Bergen School of Architecture and researcher of the urbanised sea, combine forces with interdisciplinary experts to guide the reader through this complex and fascinating topic",

    "abstract": "Seafloor geology and potential benthic habitats were mapped in Muir Inlet, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska, using multibeam sonar, ground-truth information, and geological interpretations. Muir Inlet is a recently deglaciated fjord that is under the influence of glacial and paraglacial marine processes. High glacially derived sediment and meltwater fluxes, slope instabilities, and variable bathymetry result in a highly dynamic estuarine environment and benthic ecosystem. We characterize the fjord seafloor and potential benthic habitats using the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) recently developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NatureServe. Substrates within Muir Inlet are dominated by mud, derived from the high glacial debris flux. Water-column characteristics are derived from a combination of conductivity temperature depth (CTD) measurements and circulation-model results. We also present modern glaciomarine sediment accumulation data from quantitative differential bathymetry. These data show Muir Inlet is divided into two contrasting environments: a dynamic upper fjord and a relatively static lower fjord. The accompanying maps represent the first publicly available high-resolution bathymetric surveys of Muir Inlet. The results of these analyses serve as a test of the CMECS and as a baseline for continued mapping and correlations among seafloor substrate, benthic habitats, and glaciomarine processes",

    "abstract": "This report details work carried out by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and\n\nAquaculture Science (Cefas), British Geological Surveys (BGS) and Envision Ltd. for the\n\nJoint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). It has been produced to provide the JNCC\n\nwith evidence on the distribution and extent of Annex I habitat (including variations of these\n\nfeatures) on the Dogger Bank in advance of its possible designation as a Special Area of\n\nConservation (SAC). The report contains information required under Regulation 7 of the\n\nConservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 2007 and will enable the JNCC to advise\n\nthe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as to whether the site is\n\ndeemed eligible as a SAC. The report provides detailed information about the Dogger Bank\n\nand evaluates its features of interest according to the Habitats Directive selection criteria and\n\nguiding principles. This assessment has been made following a thorough analysis of existing\n\ninformation combined with newly acquired field survey data collected using ‘state of the art’\n\nequipment.\n\nIn support of this process acoustic (sidescan sonar and multibeam echosounder) and groundtruthing\n\ndata (Hamon grabs, trawls and underwater video) were collected during a 19-day\n\ncruise on RV Cefas Endeavour, which took place between 2-20 April 2008. Existing\n\ninformation and newly acquired data were combined to investigate the sub-surface geology,\n\nsurface sediments and bedforms, epifaunal and infaunal communities of the Dogger Bank.\n\nResults were integrated into a habitat map employing the EUNIS classification. Key results\n\nare as follows:\n\n• The upper Pleistocene Dogger Bank Formation dictates the shape of the Dogger Bank.\n\n• The Dogger Bank is morphologically distinguishable from the surrounding seafloor\n\nfollowing the application of a technique, which differentiates the degree of slope.\n\n• A sheet of Holocene sediments of variable thickness overlies the Dogger Bank\n\nFormation. At the seabed surface, these Holocene sediments can be broadly delineated\n\ninto fine sands and coarse sediments.\n\n• Epifaunal and infaunal communities were distinguished based on multivariate analysis\n\nof data derived from video and stills analysis and Hamon grab samples. Sediment\n\nproperties and depth were the main factors controlling the distribution of infauna and\n\nepifauna across the Bank.\n\n• Epifaunal and infaunal community links were explored. Most stations could be\n\ncategorised according to one of four combined infaunal/epifaunal community types (i.e.\n\nsandy sediment bank community, shallow sandy sediment bank community, coarse\n\nsediment bank community or deep community north of the bank).\n\n• Biological zones were identified using modelling techniques based on light climate and\n\nwave base data. Three biological zones, namely infralittoral, circalittoral and deep\n\ncircalittoral are present in the study site.\n\n• EUNIS level 4 habitats were mapped by integrating acoustic, biological, physical and\n\noptical data. Eight different habitats are present on the Dogger Bank.\n\nThis report also provides some of the necessary information and data to help the JNCC\n\nultimately reach a judgement as to whether the Dogger Bank is suitable as an SAC. In\n\nsupport of this process the encountered habitats and the ecology of the Dogger Bank are\n\ncompared with other SACs known to contain sandbank habitats in UK waters. The\n\nfunctional and ecological importance of the Dogger Bank as well as potential anthropogenic impacts is discussed. A scientific justification underlying the proposed Dogger Bank dSAC\n\nboundary is also given (Appendix 1). This is followed by a discussion of the suitability and\n\ncost-effectiveness of techniques utilised for seabed investigations of the Dogger Bank.\n\nFinally, recommendations for strategies and techniques employed for investigation of Annex\n\nI sandbanks are provided",

    "abstract": "Human activities and the resultant pressures they place on the marine environment have been widely demonstrated to contribute to habitat degradation, therefore, their identification and quantification is an essential step towards any meaningful restoration effort. The overall scope of MERCES Deliverable 1.2 is to review current knowledge regarding the major marine pressures placed upon marine ecosystems in EU waters and the mechanisms by which they impact habitats in order to determine potential restoration pathways. An understanding of their geographical distribution is critical for any local assessment of degradation, as well as for planning conservation and restoration actions. This information would ideally be in the form of maps, which: (a) compile single or multiple activities and pressures over broad scales, integrating and visualizing available data and allowing direct identification of aggregations as well as gaps and (b) may be overlaid with habitat maps (or any other map layer containing additional information), thus combining different data levels and producing new information to be used for example when implementing EU policies. The deliverable also documents typical example habitat case studies, the prominent impacts and consequences of activities and pressures towards the identification of possible restoration or mitigation actions. Finally the deliverable discusses pressures, assessments, marine spatial planning and blue growth potential.\n\nActivities and pressures are used in a strict sense, where marine activities are undertaken to satisfy the needs of societal drivers (e.g. aquaculture or tourism) and pressures are considered to be the mechanism through which an activity has an actual or potential effect on any part of the ecosystem (e.g. for demersal trawling activity, one pressure would be abrasion of the seabed). Habitats are addressed using a nested approach from large-scale geological features (e.g. shallow soft bottoms) to species-characterised habitats (e.g. Posidonia meadows) because of the way they are referred to in current policy documents which lack standard and precise definitions",

    "abstract": "During the last decades, several EU Directives and other international legislations have generated a large number of national initiatives (e.g. marine atlases) and EU programmes on habitat mapping. Nevertheless, the outcomes of these initiatives are fragmented and, to our best knowledge, to date there is no systematic assessment regarding the nature, quality and availability of information across the European seas. One of the main goals of the MERCES project (www.merces-project.eu) is to produce a census of available maps of European key marine habitats, along with their degradation status and restoration potential in the European Seas, providing a potential basis for future discussion on restoration activities.\n\nMERCES is producing a census of European marine key habitat maps, degraded habitat maps and investigating key habitat restoration potential. To do this MERCES has\n\ni. reviewed known existing habitat maps of European regional seas and provided source citations for all of the information\n\nii. reviewed degraded habitat map resources by regional sea and habitat type (e.g. seagrass, macroalgae, coral gardens, sponge aggregations, seamounts, vents), associated habitat deterioration (e.g. extent of decline), the most common human activities and pressures reported, and the recovery and restoration potential of these habitats\n\niii. reviewed 6 key habitats (including kelp and macroalgal forests, seagrass meadows, coralligenous assemblages, coral gardens and deep-sea bottom communities) and linked 6 major habitat features, such as dynamics, connectivity, structural complexity and vulnerability, to consequences for restoration and the likelihood of restoration succes",

However, because the ecosystem approach is broadly inclusive, the science for its implementation is often considered to be overly complex and difficult. When the science needed for an ecosystem approach to fisheries is perceived this way, science products cannot keep pace with fisheries critics, thus encouraging partisan political interference in fisheries management and proliferation of “faith-based solutions. In this paper we argue that one way to effectively counter politicization of fisheries decision-making is to ensure that new ecosystem-based approaches in fisheries are viewed only as an emergent property of innovation in science and policy. We organize our essay using three major themes to focus the discussion: empirical, jurisdictional, and societal challenges. We undertake at least partial answers to the following questions: (1) has conventional fisheries management really failed?; (2) can short-comings in conventional fisheries management be augmented with new tools, such as allocation of rights?; (3) is the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) equivalent to Ecosystem-Based Management?; and (4) is restoration of degraded ecosystems a necessary component of an EAF",

The role of sand lances (Ammodytes sp.) in the Northwest Atlantic ecosystem: a synthesis of current knowledge with implications for conservation and management. Fish and Fisheries, 00, (2020): 1-34, doi:10.1111/faf.12445.The American sand lance (Ammodytes americanus, Ammodytidae) and the Northern sand lance (A. dubius, Ammodytidae) are small forage fishes that play an important functional role in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). The NWA is a highly dynamic ecosystem currently facing increased risks from climate change, fishing and energy development. We need a better understanding of the biology, population dynamics and ecosystem role of Ammodytes to inform relevant management, climate adaptation and conservation efforts. To meet this need, we synthesized available data on the (a) life history, behaviour and distribution; (b) trophic ecology; (c) threats and vulnerabilities; and (d) ecosystem services role of Ammodytes in the NWA. Overall, 72 regional predators including 45 species of fishes, two squids, 16 seabirds and nine marine mammals were found to consume Ammodytes. Priority research needs identified during this effort include basic information on the patterns and drivers in abundance and distribution of Ammodytes, improved assessments of reproductive biology schedules and investigations of regional sensitivity and resilience to climate change, fishing and habitat disturbance. Food web studies are also needed to evaluate trophic linkages and to assess the consequences of inconsistent zooplankton prey and predator fields on energy flow within the NWA ecosystem. Synthesis results represent the first comprehensive assessment of Ammodytes in the NWA and are intended to inform new research and support regional ecosystem‐based management approaches.This manuscript is the result of follow‐up work stemming from a working group formed at a two‐day multidisciplinary and international workshop held at the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge, Massachusetts in May 2017, which convened 55 experts scientists, natural resource managers and conservation practitioners from 15 state, federal, academic and non‐governmental organizations with interest and expertise in Ammodytes ecology.

    "abstract": "Fisheries resources play a crucial role in economic development, food security, and healthy nutrition for humans. Consequently, fisheries are of paramount importance for several Sustainable Development Goals, in particular SDGs 1 and 8, which are related to poverty and economic growth, as well as SDGs 2 and 3, which are about zero hunger and good health. On the other hand, fisheries can also negatively influence the ecosystem (SDG 14, life below water). Thailand is one of the world’s most significant producers and exporters of fisheries products. This present work describes the evolution of wild fisheries production in Thailand for over twenty years and discusses its impact on fish and shellfish supplies. The present overview uses mainly the official statistical catch data of Thailand. From 1995 to 2015, Thailand’s marine fisheries production gradually decreased from approximately 2.8 million tonnes to 1.3 million tonnes per year. Concerning taxonomic composition of the catches, no dramatic shifts were recorded during the 20-year period. The main observation seems that for less abundant taxa, such as Chirocentridae, Sillaginidae, Ariidae, Sharks, and Psettodidae, their part in the catch was halved between 1995 and 2015. On the other hand, inland capture fisheries remained constant at 0.2 million tonnes per year. The annual value of wild fisheries production was, on average US$1.7 billion. Notably, trawl fishing systematically reduced during these two decennia, resulting in a fishing efficiency of approximately 140 tonnes of demersal fish per trawl unit per year in 2015. During 2008–2015, the number of registered gill net fishing boats drastically increased from 2,300 to 6,600, and this has led to a dramatic decline in fishing efficiency to about 10% in 2014–2015. More in general, Thailand’s continuous decline in marine capture production was linked to increased fuel prices, tightening restrictions by neighbouring countries for access into their exclusive economic zone, and the depletion of resources due to overfishing and illegal fishing. Against rising concerns about the sustainability of intensive fishing practices in recent years, Thailand is ramping up efforts to reduce the exploitation of fishery resources to levels that would achieve maximum sustainable yields. In particular, the intensity of fishing based on gill nets needs to be addressed in the future. Hence, Thailand’s fisheries production faces the pressure of realising the importance of sustainable fisheries resources management and its impact on marine life and biodiversity, in addition to its role as a significant food source for a healthy population",

    "abstract": "Fisheries and aquaculture production, imports, exports and equitability of distribution determine the supply of aquatic food to people. Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand",

The definitive version was published in Oceanography 31, no. 1 (2018): 16–35, doi:10.5670/oceanog.2018.105.The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is an integrated suite of instrumented platforms and discrete instruments that measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological properties from the seafloor to the sea surface. The OOI provides data to address large-scale scientific challenges such as coastal ocean dynamics, climate and ecosystem health, the global carbon cycle, and linkages among seafloor volcanism and life. The OOI Cyberinfrastructure currently serves over 250 terabytes of data from the arrays. These data are freely available to users worldwide, changing the way scientists and the broader community interact with the ocean, and permitting ocean research and inquiry at scales of centimeters to kilometers and seconds to decades.Funding for the OOI is provided by the National\r\nScience Foundation through a Cooperative\r\nSupport Agreement with the Consortium for Ocean\r\nLeadership (OCE-1026342)",

    "abstract": "In October 2005, a consortium of partners led by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) proposed a project aimed at integrating fish resources management in agricultural management in the Tonle Sap area. This 2-years project assistance was accepted for funding by the Challenge Program on Water and Food and started in January 2008. The overall goal of this project is to improve allocation and use of water in combined farming and fishing systems in order to enhance food security of rural communities and water productivity. The general objectives of the Fisheries component are: 1) to contribute to the review of existing fisheries and aquaculture information, assessment and data collection systems and existing databases from a fisheries perspective 2) to determine key questions that could be asked at the commune level that would enable the identification of fisheries issues for different agroecosystem zones. These would include both threats and potential threats to fisheries based on key ecological variables and opportunities that fisheries and aquaculture could represent in local livelihoods.Research, Lake fisheries, Agropisciculture, Ecosystems, Analysis, Cambodia, Tonle Sap L.,",

This crisis is one of water governance, essentially caused by the ways in which we mismanage water. But the real tragedy is the effect it has on the everyday lives of poor people, who are blighted by the burden of water-related disease, living in degraded and often dangerous environments, struggling to get an education for their children and to earn a living, and to get enough to eat. The executive summary offers an analysis of the problem as well as pilot case studies for water management and recommendations for future action",

    "abstract": "This dissertation comprises two parts, they are linked in their recognition that fisheries, as an ecosystem service of inland surface waters, are poorly understood and undervalued. The first chapter explores how the distribution of livelihood strategies and assets may determine household sensitivity and adaptive capacity to hydrological change in the Lower Mekong Basin. Using an index-based approach relative susceptibility scores were calculated for 2,703 households living within close proximity of the Mekong River. The findings suggest that policies aimed at reducing vulnerability to hydrological change in the Lower Mekong Basin should account for geographic context. Further, the study highlights how policies may be able to strategically target the most susceptible households but that poorly designed policies have the potential to exacerbate vulnerability. In the face of high uncertainty surrounding hydrological change in the Lower Mekong Basin, our assessment of susceptibility should help inform precautionary water management policies and provide baseline information needed for more comprehensive vulnerability assessments in the future.\n\nThe second chapter of this dissertation presents a structured review of inland fisheries economic research. Bibliographic databases were searched for suitable peer-reviewed articles. The selected studies (n=75) were analysed for coverage, valuation methodologies, and value metrics. The findings provide an overview of trends in study design and current understanding of inland fisheries economics and highlights knowledge gaps and methodological shortcomings. The study highlights the need for a greater quantity of inland capture fisheries economic research that covers a representative sample of ecosystems and fishery types globally. Best practice recommendations are made. These aim to ensure future inland capture fisheries research generates economically credible and comparable values. Economic valuation can inform the sustainable management of inland capture fisheries and ensure they are recognised in trade-off analysis and decision-making.\n\nBoth studies provide valuable contributions to inland fisheries research. The extensive data coverage of the first study is unprecedented for the assessment of household vulnerability to hydrological change in the Mekong Basin. As far as I am aware, the second study is the first review of inland fisheries literature that explicitly focused on an overview of economics research. This dissertation has highlighted that the management of inland fisheries has environmental, economic and social implications, and that for these to be accounted for in decision-making processes fisheries must be economically valued to capture the value of the fishery as fully as possible, i.e. to include use and non-use values of all beneficiaries. This presents a vast challenge. Ultimately, unless future research strategically addresses the economic research shortcomings identified in this dissertation, inland fisheries will continue to be overlooked in decision-making and their sustainable management will be crippled by our lack of understanding",

    "abstract": "This paper presents historical information regarding the development of the aquatic resource co-management system in Khong District, Champasak Province, Southern Lao PDF. Between 1993 and 1998, 63 villages in Khong District established co-management regulations to sustainably manage and conserve inland aquatic resources, including fisheries, in the Mekong River, streams, backwater wetlands, and rice paddy fields. Local government has endorsed these regulations, but villages have been given the mandate to choose what regulations to adopt based on local conditions and community consensus. Communities are also empowered to alter regulations in response to changing circumstances. Villagers have widely reported increased fish catches since the adoption of aquatic resource co-management regulations. Improved solidarity and coordination within and between rural fishing and farming villages has also been observed. While many of the lessons learned from the co-management experience in Khong are applicable to other parts of Laos and the region, unique conditions in different areas will require inventive approaches to meet local needs. Common property regimes can break down in crisis, but experience in Khong indicates that they can also be strengthened in response to resource management crisis",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe objective of this research was to investigate and test the necessary steps in developing an adaptation planning framework for freshwater biodiversity. We used Tasmania as a test case to demonstrate how downscaled climate model outputs could be integrated with spatially resolved hydrological models and freshwater biodiversity data. This enabled us to scope adaptation actions at local, regional and state scales for Tasmania, and to explore how priorities might be set.To achieve this integration we quantified how different climate change scenarios could affect the risks to biodiversity and ecosystem values (‘biodiversity assets’) in freshwaters, the scope and types of adaptation actions, and assessed the strengths and weaknesses of the policy and planning instruments in responding to climate change.We concluded that downscaled climate modelling, linked with modelling of catchment and hydrological processes, refines projections for climate-driven risks to aquatic environments. Spatial and temporal hazards and risks can now be compared at a variety of scales, as well as comparisons between biodiversity assets (e.g. relative risk to riparian vegetation v. in-stream biota). Uncertainties can be identified and built into adaptation processes. Notwithstanding this progress, we identified a number of issues that need to be addressed in order to increase confidence in this process.The main issues for improved and timely modelling are: frameworks for using and downscaling outputs from improved global climate models as they become available; better data on thermal tolerances of freshwater biota; and, improved methods for predicting key water temperature variables from air temperature and other biophysical predictors. Improvements are also needed in updating and maintaining high quality biodiversity data sets, and better spatially explicit information on the contributions of groundwater to surface waters and rates of recharge.The list of adaptation options available is extensive, but the key challenge is to organise these options so that stakeholders are not overwhelmed.  Scenario modelling that incorporates explicit tools for comparing costs, benefits, feasibility and social acceptability should help with setting priorities but require further development.A review of current Australian policies revealed a variety of responses driven by both water reform and climate change agendas. Many agencies are actively revising their policies to accommodate adaptation. However, we note that much of the reform of the water sector in the last 10–15 years has aimed to improve certainty for non-environmental water uses. Under the National Water Initiative, governments have agreed that entitlement holders should bear the risks of reduced volumes or reliability of their water allocations as a result of changes in climate. The key opportunity for adaptive uptake of climate adaptations is by developing and periodically reviewing water management planning tools. Pathways need to be developed for integrating the traditional evolution of planning and policy with the needs for climate change adaptation for aquatic ecosystems. Formal mechanisms for the uptake of knowledge about identified risks into policy and legislative instruments remain under-developed. An even bigger challenge is to integrate multiple adaptation strategies (sometimes at different scales) to achieve specific adaptation objectives within regions or catchments—especially where a mix of water management and non-water management is required",

    "abstract": "Ocean fisheries and marine aquaculture are an important but often overlooked component of world food security. For example, of the seven billion (and counting) people on the planet, over one billion depend on fish as their primary source of protein, and fish is a primary source of protein (30 percent or more of protein consumed) in many countries around the world, including Japan, Greenland, Taiwan, Indonesia, several countries in Africa, and several South Pacific island nations.  Marine fisheries and marine aquaculture have been subject to a number of stressors that can undermine world food security, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. However, climate change poses new and significant threats to marine fisheries and aquaculture that could both reduce the global marine food resource base and render ineffective current fisheries management. As a result, the resilience of the marine food supply into the future is very much in question, threatening food security in sometimes insidious ways. This Article first explores humans’ dependence on wild-caught marine fish and marine aquaculture before examining the emerging threats that climate change poses to wild fish stocks, marine aquaculture, and fisheries management. It then examines six ways that governments could internationally and individually re-tool marine-related governance systems to adapt to this climate change era, particularly by recognizing that fish stocks are increasingly likely to shift their ranges from historical norms and by recognizing that marine aquaculture may not be possible in all places. The Article concludes, however, that while productive re-tooling is still possible, the world also needs to face the probability that marine fish and marine aquaculture will become increasingly unreliable sources of food and that resilience-focused governance policies for marine aquaculture in particular will become increasingly important",

We look at the role of banks and investors in financing the transition towards clean, low-carbon technologies, as well as opportunities in data and analytics. We examine solutions to marine plastic pollution from source to sea, and the ocean’s potential to remove carbon from the atmosphere and increase resilience to the impacts of climate change. The report also highlights the important role of impact investors. These are private-sector investors that seek to make a profit from their investments as well as generating environmental and social benefits. As such, they will typically tolerate longer investment horizons than mainstream investors. One such investment is the Dominican Republic’s Arrecifes del Sureste marine sanctuary",

Free access to and availability of ocean resources and services, together with human development, have put strong pressures on marine ecosystems, ranging from overfishing and reckless resource extraction to various channels of careless pollution. International cooperation and negotiations are required to protect the marine environment and use marine resources in a way that the needs of future generations will be met. For that purpose, developing and agreeing on a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Oceans and Coasts could be an essential element for sustainable ocean management. The SDGs will build upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and replace them by 2015. Even though ensuring environmental sustainability is one of the eight MDG goals, the ocean is not explicitly included. Furthermore, the creation of a comprehensive underlying set of oceanic sustainability indicators would help assessing the current status of marine systems, diagnose on-going trends, and provide information for forward-locking and sustainable ocean governance",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, as wild-caught commercial fisheries plateau and human demands for protein increase, marine aquaculture is expanding. Much marine aquaculture is inherently adaptable to changing climatic and chemical conditions. Nevertheless, siting of marine aquaculture operations is subject to competing environmental, economic, and social demands upon and priorities for ocean space, while some forms of marine aquaculture can impose other externalities on marine systems, such as pollution from wastes (nutrients) and antibiotics, consumption of wild fish as food, and introduction of non-native or genetically modified species. As a result, governmental policy decisions to promote both marine aquaculture that can adapt to a changing ocean and adaptive governance for that aquaculture can become contested, requiring attention to their social legitimacy. This article explores how the law can promote the adaptability of marine aquaculture to climate change and ocean acidification — adaptive marine aquaculture — while still preserving key rule-of-law values, such as public participation and accountability. Perhaps most obviously, law can establish substantive requirements for marine aquaculture that minimize its impacts, promoting marine resilience overall. However, to foster truly adaptive marine aquaculture, including adaptive governance institutions, coastal nations should also procedurally reform their marine spatial planning efforts to legally connect the procedures for aquaculture permitting, marine spatial planning (MSP), and adaptive management. One goal of such connections, moreover, should be to mandate new forums for public participation and creative collaboration, promote experimentation with accountability that leads to increased knowledge, and foster the emergence of adaptive governance regarding the use of marine space",

    "abstract": "The ocean regulates the global climate, provides humans with natural resources such as food, materials, important substances, and energy, and is essential for international trade and recreational and cultural activities. Together with human development and economic growth, free access to, and availability of, ocean resources and services have exerted strong pressure on marine systems, ranging from overfishing, increasing resource extraction, and alteration of coastal zones to various types of thoughtless pollution. Both economic theory and many case studies suggest that there is no “tragedy of the commons” but a “tragedy of open access”. With high likeliness, structures of open access are non-sustainable. International cooperation and effective governance are required to protect the marine environment and promote the sustainable use of marine resources in such a way that due account can be taken of the environmental values of current generations and the needs of future generations. For this purpose, developing and agreeing on one Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) specifically for the Ocean and Coasts could prove to be an essential element. The new SDGs will build upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and replace them by 2015. Ensuring environmental sustainability in a general sense is one of the eight MDGs but the ocean is not explicitly addressed. Furthermore, the creation of a comprehensive underlying set of ocean sustainability targets and effective indicators developed within a global Future Ocean Spatial Planning (FOSP) process would help in assessing the current status of marine systems, diagnosing ongoing trends, and providing information for inclusive, forward-looking, and sustainable ocean governanc",

    "abstract": "Blue Economy is related to economic growth through the sustainable utilization of ocean resources with technological inputs to improve livelihoods. Economically important coastal and marine resources are the main components of the Blue Economy for Bangladesh. These resources are categorized into living, non-living, renewable resources and trade and commerce. As Bangladesh is vulnerable to climate change, related extreme events are making the coastal and marine resources vulnerable which may hamper the smooth Blue Economy development in Bangladesh. Climate change extreme events include warming trend, cyclone, sea level rise, droughts, erosion, tidal surge, saline water intrusion, flood, change in precipitation trend and ocean acidification. These extreme events may cause coral belching, species migration, biodiversity loss, altered species life style, disruption in marine food chain and ultimately will affect the national economy. Thus, it is a prime need to build marine ecosystem’s resilience to climate change to get the maximum benefits from ocean. This background paper offers a strategic framework for climate change resilient Blue Economy practice in Bangladesh. This framework is a four steps process (i.e. identification of issues, focus on important areas for climate change resilient Blue Economy development, performing activities for achieving the goal and achievement of goal). Special focus is required on energy efficiency, marine and coastal biodiversity, ecosystem based adaptation, environmental resilience building in the coastal areas, ecosystem restoration, building economic resilience and policy formulation for climate change resilient Blue Economy development. Mangrove plantation, oyster reef building, mussel bed, sea grass bed, salt marsh bed and coral reef conservation, use of renewable energy, special interventions in fisheries and development of islands, crop insurance, salt tolerant and floating agriculture, eco-tourism development, MPA and ecologically critical area declaration, marine spatial planning, policy formulation, institutional integration and continuous ocean monitoring are example of some possible interventions required for climate resilient Blue Economy development in Bangladesh",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a summary of the state of knowledge on ocean acidification.Summary of outcomes:The ocean continues to acidify at an unprecedented rate in Earth’s history. Latest research indicates the rate of change may be faster than at any time in the last 300 million years.As ocean acidity increases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere decreases. This decreases the ocean’s role in moderating climate change. Species-specific impacts of ocean acidification have been seen in laboratory and field studies on organisms from the poles to the tropics. Many organisms show adverse effects, such as reduced ability to form and maintain shells and skeletons, as well as reduced survival, growth, abundance and larval development. Conversely, evidence indicates that some organisms tolerate ocean acidification and that others, such as some seagrasses, may even thrive. Within decades, large parts of the polar oceans will become corrosive to the unprotected shells of calcareous marine organisms. Changes in carbonate chemistry of the tropical ocean may hamper or prevent coral reef growth within decades.The far-reaching effects of ocean acidification are predicted to impact food webs, biodiversity, aquaculture and hence societies. Species differ in their potential to adapt to new environments. Ocean chemistry may be changing too rapidly for many species or populations to adapt through evolution.Multiple stressors – ocean acidification, warming, decreases in oceanic oxygen concentrations (deoxygenation), increasing UV-B irradiance due to stratospheric ozone depletion, overfishing, pollution and eutrophication – and their interactions are creating significant challenges for ocean ecosystems. We do not fully understand the biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system that may arise from ocean acidification. Predicting how whole ecosystems will change in response to rising CO2 levels remains challenging. While we know enough to expect changes in marine ecosystems and biodiversity within our lifetimes, we are unable to make reliable, quantitative predictions of socio-economic impacts. People who rely on the ocean’s ecosystem services are especially vulnerable and may need to adapt or cope with ocean acidification impacts within decades. Shellfish fisheries and aquaculture in some areas may be able to cope by adjusting their management practices to avoid ocean acidification impacts. Tropical coral reef loss will affect tourism, food security and Katharina Fabricius shoreline protection for many of the world’s poorest people.Authors: Wendy Broadgate, IGBP; Ulf Riebesell, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany; Claire Armstrong, University of Tromsø, Norway; Peter Brewer, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, USA; Ken Denman, University of Victoria, Canada; Richard Feely, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, NOAA, USA; Kunshan Gao, Xiamen University, China; Jean-Pierre Gattuso, CNRS-UPMC, Laboratoire d’Océanographie, France; Kirsten Isensee, IOC-UNESCO; Joan Kleypas, National Center for Atmospheric Research (Climate and Global Dynamics), USA; Dan Laffoley, International Union for Conservation of Nature, Switzerland; James Orr, Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et l’Environnement, France; Hans-Otto Pörtner, Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany; Carlos Eduardo de Rezende, Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminese, Brazil; Daniela Schmidt, University of Bristol, UK; Ed Urban, SCOR; Anya Waite, University of Western Australia; Luis Valdés, IOC-UNESCO",

Achieving this goal will require rebuilding the marine life-support systems that deliver the many benefits society receives from a healthy ocean. In this Review we document the recovery of marine populations, habitats and ecosystems following past conservation interventions. Recovery rates across studies suggest that substantial recovery of the abundance, structure, and function of marine life could be achieved by 2050, should major pressures, including climate change, be mitigated. Rebuilding marine life represents a doable Grand Challenge for humanity, and ethical obligation, and a smart economic objective to achieve a sustainable future",

    "abstract": "Climate change is rapidly and significantly impacting the planet and the ocean in harmful ways. (Environment U.N., 2017). (NOAA, 2019). (NASA, 2024). (Nature Conservancy, n.d.). The Earth’s average surface temperature in 2024 was the warmest on record, according to an analysis led by NASA scientists. (2024). Coral reefs are experiencing negative climate impacts more quickly and more severely than the ocean in total. Our research addresses global coral threats like ocean warming, acidification, and extreme storms, plus local threats like overfishing, marine migration, invasive species, pollution, and excess nutrients. We have shown how coral reef threats, management practices, and resilience in Cuba and Australia impact the health and restoration of coral reefs. We focused this Capstone project on these elements of reef management: threats, practices, and resilience. \n\nCoral reefs provide value to our society as a home and food source for 25% of marine life. (Loiacono, 2024). Coral reefs support industry in terms of fishing, tourism, and recreation. Water sports are enhanced by the mystery, bounty, and beauty of coral reefs. (Loiacono, 2024). Currently, 30 - 50% of coral reefs have been destroyed globally. Climate change and local threats greatly weaken coral reefs leading to damage, disease, and death. (Environment U.N., 2017). (NOAA, 2019). (NASA, 2024). (Nature Conservancy, n.d.). Reef management practices provide options to preserve, recover, and save these amazing coral reef ecosystems. Local management priorities for Cuba and Australia include Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), multi-purpose objective setting, bioscience solutions, and ecological role management. These significant actions can provide value to other coral areas. Climate action is a topic for further research",

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Knowledge of factors that are important in coral reef growth help us to understand how reef ecosystems react following major environmental disturbances due to climate change and other anthropogenic effects. This study shows that despite a range of anthropogenic stressors, corals on the fringing reefs south of Kingston harbour, as well as corals on fringing reefs on the north coast of Jamaica near Discovery Bay can survive and grow. Skewness values for Sidastrea siderea and Porites astreoides were positive (0.85 1.64) for all sites, implying more small colonies than large colonies. Coral growth rates are part of a demographic approach to monitoring coral reef health in times of climate change, and linear extension rates (mm.yr-1) of Acropora palmata branching corals at Dairy Bull, Rio Bueno, and Pear Tree Bottom on the north coast of Jamaica were c. 50 90 mm.year-1 from 2005-2012. The range of small-scale rugosities at the Port Royal cay sites studied was lower than that at the Discovery Bay sites; for example Rio Bueno was 1.05 ± 0.15 and Dairy Bull the most rugose at 2.3 ± 0.16. Diary Bull reef has for several years been the fringing reef with the most coral cover, with a benthic community similar to that of the 1970s. We discuss whether Jamaica can learn from methods used in other Caribbean countries to better protect its coral reefs against climate change. Establishing and maintaining fully-protected marine parks in Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean is one tool to help the future of the fishing industry in developing countries. Developing MPAs as part of an overall climate change policy for a country may be the best way of integrating climate change into MPA planning, management, and evaluation",

    "abstract": "1. The ocean crisis is urgent and central to human well-being and life on Earth; past and current activities are damaging the planet's main life support system for future generations. We are witnessing an increase in ocean heat, disturbance, acidification, bio-invasions and nutrients, and reducing oxygen. Several of these act like ratchets: once detrimental or negative changes have occurred, they may lock in place and may not be reversible, especially at gross ecological and ocean process scales. 2. Each change may represent a loss to humanity of resources, ecosystem function, oxygen production and species. The longer we pursue unsuitable actions, the more we close the path to recovery and better ocean health and greater benefits for humanity in the future.3. We stand at a critical juncture and have identified eight priority issues that need to be addressed in unison to help avert a potential ecological disaster in the global ocean. They form a purposely ambitious agenda for global governance and are aimed at informing decision-makers at a high level.4. Of all the themes, the highest priority is to rigorously address global warming and limit surface temperature rise to 1.5°C by 2100, as warming is the pre-eminent factor driving change in the ocean. The other themes are establishing a robust and comprehensive High Seas Treaty, enforcing existing standards for MPAs and expanding their coverage, especially in terms of high levels of protection, imposing a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining, ending overfishing and destructive fishing practices, radically reducing marine pollution, putting in place a financing mechanism for ocean management and protection and, lastly, scaling-up science/data gathering and facilitating data sharing.5. By implementing all eight measures in unison, as a coordinated strategy, we can build resilience to climate change, help sustain fisheries productivity, particularly for low-income countries dependent on fisheries, protect coasts (e.g. via soft-engineering/habitat-based approaches),promote mitigation (e.g. carbon storage) and enable improved adaptation to rapid global change",

However, even these decreases will not avert serious stress and damage to life on Earth, and additional steps are needed to boost the resilience of ecosystems, safeguard their wildlife, and protect their capacity to supply vital goods and services. We discuss how well-managed marine reserves may help marine ecosystems and people adapt to five prominent impacts of climate change: acidification, sea-level rise, intensification of storms, shifts in species distribution, and decreased productivity and oxygen availability, as well as their cumulative effects. We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-tech, cost-effective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future",

    "abstract": "Navigating the Future is a publication series produced by the European Marine Board providing future\n\nperspectives on marine science and technology in Europe. Navigating the Future V (NFV) highlights new\n\nknowledge obtained since Navigating the Future IV1 (2013). It is set within the framework of the 2015\n\nParis Agreement2 and builds on the scientific basis and recommendations of the IPCC reports3. NFV gives\n\nrecommendations on the science required during the next decade to deliver the ocean we need to support\n\na sustainable future. This will be important for the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable\n\nDevelopment4 (2021 – 2030), the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals5 and the\n\nEuropean Commission’s next framework programme, Horizon Europe6 (2021 - 2027). There is a growing need\n\nto strengthen the links between marine science, society and policy since we cannot properly manage what\n\nwe do not know.\n\nIn recent years, the ocean and seas have received new prominence in international agendas. To secure a\n\nsafe planet a priority is the management of the ocean as a “common good for humanity”, which requires\n\nsmarter observations to assess of the state of the ocean and predictions about how it may change in the\n\nfuture. The ocean is a three-dimensional space that needs to be managed over time (thus four-dimensional),\n\nand there is a need for management and conservation practices that integrate the structure and function\n\nof marine ecosystems into these four dimensions (Chapter 2). This includes understanding the dynamic\n\nspatial and temporal interplay between ocean physics, chemistry and biology. Multiple stressors including\n\nclimate change, pollution and over-fishing affect the ocean and we need to better understand and predict\n\ntheir interactions and identify tipping points to decide on management priorities (Chapter 3). This should\n\nintegrate our understanding of land-ocean-atmosphere processes and approaches to reducing impacts. An\n\nimproved science base is also needed to help predict and minimize the impact of extreme events such as\n\nstorm surges, heat waves, dynamic sea-floor processes and tsunamis (Chapter 4). New technologies, data\n\nhandling and modelling approaches will help us to observe, understand and manage our use of the fourdimensional\n\nocean and the effect of multiple stressors (Chapter 5).\n\nAddressing these issues requires a strategic, collective and holistic approach and we need to build a\n\ncommunity of sustainability scientists that are able to provide evidence-based support to policy makers\n\nwithin the context of major societal challenges (Chapter 6). We outline new frontiers, knowledge gaps and\n\nrecommendations needed to manage the ocean as a common good and to develop solutions for a sustainable\n\nfuture (Chapter 7). The governance of sustainability should be at the core of the marine research agenda\n\nthrough co-production and collaboration with stakeholders to identify priorities. There is need for a fully\n\nintegrated scientific assessment of resilience strategies, associated trade-offs and underlying ethical concepts\n\nfor the ocean, which should be incorporated into decision support frameworks that involve stakeholders from\n\nthe outset. To allow the collection, processing and access to all data, a key priority is the development of a\n\nbusiness model that ensures the long-term economic sustainability of ocean observations",

    "abstract": "This publication is primarily aimed at stakeholders involved in ocean observing, spanning diverse roles from commissioning,\r\nmanaging, funding and coordinating, to developing, implementing, or advising on, ocean observation programmes.\r\nSuch programmes will have strategic and policy drivers but their main purpose may vary from predominantly researchdriven\r\nscientific purposes to environmental monitoring for providing data and reporting to legally-binding regulations or\r\ndirectives. The main focus is on European capabilities but set in a global context with the various actors spanning a variety\r\nof geographical scales from national to regional and European. Key stakeholder organizations include environmental or\r\nother agencies; marine research institutions, their researchers and operators; international and regional ocean observing\r\ninitiatives and programmes; national, regional and European policy makers and their advisors; national stations for\r\nobservations; etc.). It will also be of interest to the wider marine and maritime research and policy community.\r\nThe main aim of the publication is to increase the relevance of current (and future) European biological ocean observation\r\ncapacity to strengthen global efforts towards our understanding of the ocean and enhance marine biodiversity\r\nconservation, for maintaining a healthy ocean for healthy societies.\r\nThis document explains why biological ocean observations are needed to assess progress against national and international\r\nconservation targets, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Blue Growth agenda and to contribute to key EU\r\ndirectives including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). To achieve this, the publication highlights the need\r\nof biological ocean observations to reflect clearly defined hypotheses about potential causes of change, including the\r\ncombined impacts of local and global drivers, and to support the management of our impacts on the ocean. Additionally,\r\nit calls for flexible biological ocean observing programmes to capture the relevant drivers operating at multiple spatial\r\nscales, by networking and integration of ongoing monitoring programmes, methodological standardization and\r\nappropriate policies of data integration and dissemination. It then presents key variables, elements and information\r\nproducts to inform on the status and trends of marine biodiversity",

    "abstract": "A total of 98 marine mammal records from Iranian coastal waters of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman were compiled of which 66 are previously unpublished new records. Seventy-nine were from the Persian Gulf and 16 from the Gulf of Oman coast. The largest numbers of records were from Qeshm Island and Bushehr Provinces. Records of finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) were by far the most numerous probably reflecting their inshore distribution and local abundance.  Other species recorded are common dolphin (Delphinus capensis tropicalis), rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis), Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and dugong (Dugong dugon). Evidence of 22 Mysticetes were obtained eight of which were tentatively identified as Bryde’s whales (Balaenoptera edeni), three as fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and three as humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae).  The largest threat to marine mammals in Iran is likely to be incidental capture in fishing gear. Six by-caught finless porpoises were recorded, and this species may be particularly vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets. Recommended marine mammal research, conservation and management small projects in Iran are described",

Topics include taxonomy, morphology, distribution, reproduction, pre-adult and adult stages, food, growth, migration, population characteristics, and various aspects of exploitation.\n\nData and information were obtained from unpublished as\n\nwell as published sources.\n\n\n\nCobia, the only species in the family Rachycentridae, is a\n\nmigratory pelagic fish that occurs in tropical and subtropical seas of the world, except in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. In the western Atlantic Ocean, spawning occurs during the warm months. Eggs and larvae are planktonic. Females grow faster than males: at 1 year, females are 36 cm FL and 0.4 kg; at 4 years, 99 cm and 11 kg; and at 8 years, 137 cm and 31 kg. Comparable data for males are: at 1 year, 31 cm and 0.3 kg; 4 years, 82 cm and 6 kg; and 8 years, 108 cm and 15 kg. Sexual maturity is attained by males at about 52 cm FL in their second\n\nyear and by females at about 70 cm in their third year. Fecundity for females 100-125 cm FL varies from 1.9 to 5.4 million eggs. Cobia favor crustaceans for food, but will feed on other invertebrates and fishes as well. They attain a maximum size of over 60 kg. Cobia are fished both commercially and recreationally. Commercially, they are usually caught incidentally in both hook-and-Iine and net fISheries. In the United States, which ranks behind Pakistan, Mexico, and the Philippines in commercial\n\nproduction of cobia, recreational landings exceed\n\ncommercial landings by more than ten-fold.

    "abstract": "The development of the shipbuilding industry is expected to meet the needs of the Indonesian Navy and the commercial vessels, and to support Indonesia's marine policy. The purpose of this study is to see the Shipbuilding industry Competitiveness, the influence of Technology Transfer to the Shipbuilding industry Competitiveness, and the influence of the industrial clusters on the Shipbuilding industry Competitiveness, as well as to analyze the institutional model of the Shipbuilding industry Competitiveness. This study uses the descriptive analysis, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for the model causality testing, and the Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) for the institutional model of the competitiveness of the Shipbuilding Industry. This study uses the primary data, namely a survey of defense industry players, the national industry, the defense equipment users, the government institutions, the research institutes, and the universities that are determined purposively. ISM data are obtained from questionnaires and Forum Group Discussion (FGD) with 13 speakers representing academia, industry, and government. The results of the analysis of SEM state that the indicators on the industrial clusters, the competitiveness, and the technology transfer have a significant and real contribution to these variables. This research also shows that the industrial clusters and the technology transfer have a direct and significant effect on the competitiveness and the industrial clusters directly and significantly affect the technology transfer. However, the industrial clusters also have an indirect effect on competitiveness through the technology transfer to the shipbuilding industry. The results of the analysis of ISM conclude that the stakeholders involved have the greatest driving force, namely the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, while the important factor affected by the stakeholders in strengthening the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry is the Indonesian Navy Headquarters.",

With marine planning developing in many parts of the world, especially the E.U., U.S. and Australia, it is important for industry to be part of the creation of a shared vision for a marine area, the discussion regarding whether or not to pursue a planning or other improved management effort, and the necessary elements (e.g., outreach, funding, boundaries) of such an effort. World Ocean Council, with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, undertook a project to inform and, as appropriate, engage a diverse range of ocean industries on marine planning and encourage the use of credible science and risk assessment. With information gathered through literature reviews, case studies, interviews, and outreach, this paper presents potential benefits of and concerns regarding marine planning from the ocean business perspective. It also offers considerations for industry to consider its role in marine planning and for planners on how and why to engage the private sector",

Since 2004, CI, together with a multitude of partners, has been developing the Seascapes model to manage large, multiple-use marine areas in which government authorities, private organizations, and other stakeholders cooperate to conserve the diversity and abundance of marine life and to promote human well-being. The definition of the Seascapes approach and the identification of the essential elements of a functioning Seascape were built from the ground up, informed by the extensive field experience of numerous marine management practitioners. Although the report was commissioned by CI, the views expressed in this report are those of the authors; they were charged with providing a critical examination of all the assessed approaches, including the Seascapes approach. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This will help us -- and, we hope, other readers -- to identify ways to work together to achieve even greater results through synergistic efforts",

The following guide details the approach, its assumptions, and its application to sensitivity assessment. \n\nThe guide discusses:\n\n•\tkey terms used in sensitivity assessment;\n\n•\tthe definitions and terms used in the MarESA approach;\n\n•\tits assumptions;\n\n•\tthe definition of resistance, resilience and sensitivity; \n\n•\tthe definition of pressures and their benchmarks;\n\n•\tthe step by step process by which the possible sensitivity of each feature (habitat, biotope or species) to each pressure is assessed;\n\n•\tthe interpretation and application of evidence to sensitivity assessments on a pressure by pressure basis; and\n\n•\tlimitations in the application of sensitivity assessments in management. \n\nThe MarESA methodology provides a systematic process to compile and assess the best available scientific evidence to determine each sensitivity assessment.  The evidence used is documented throughout the process to provide an audit trail to explain each sensitivity assessment.  Unlike other expert-based approaches, this means that the MarESA assessments can be repeated and updated.  \n\nThe resultant 'evidence base' is the ultimate source of information for the application of the sensitivity assessments to management and planning decisions.  The MarESA dataset and MarLIN website represent the largest review of the potential effects of human activities and natural events on the marine and coastal habitats of the North East Atlantic yet undertaken",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the project is to develop sustained small-scale cage fish culture in inland and coastal waters\n\nthrough improved understanding of the social, institutional and resource environment of resource poor groups. Two Asian countries, Bangladesh (inland systems) and Vietnam\n\n(marine), were studied with this workshop bringing together both sides of the project together with representatives of collaborative institutions, government departments and\n\nuniversities. Addressing the overall aim of producing guidelines for the planning and extension of cage aquaculture in Asia a combination of group work and plenary discussion was conducted producing the following outputs. 1) An assessment of cage aquaculture potential, 2) Development options for small-scale cage culture, 3) A review of tools and methodologies and 4) Policy initiatives for sustainable cage culture development. Key issues raised were the use of outputs as a guide to be adapted to regional circumstances to facilitate farmer and extension worker discussion and not as a rigid methodology. The\n\ndegree of linkage between development, research and government institutions was also considered a crucial factor in benefiting the research and development of cage culture at the local, regional and national level and vital in affecting the future policies by both development and government institutions.

The ever-increasing interest in work in oceanography and marine biology and its relevance to global environmental issues, especially global climate change and its impacts, creates a demand for authoritative refereed reviews summarizing and synthesizing the results of recent research. For more than 50 years, OMBAR has been an essential reference for research workers and students in all fields of marine science. This volume considers such diverse topics as optimal design for ecosystem-level ocean observatories, the oceanography and ecology of Ningaloo, human pressures and the emergence of novel marine ecosystems and priority species to support the functional integrity of coral reefs. Six of the nine peer-reviewed contributions in Volume 58 are available to read Open Access via the links on the Routledge.com webpage. An international Editorial Board ensures global relevance and expert peer review, with editors from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and the United Kingdom. The series volumes find a place in the libraries of not only marine laboratories and oceanographic institutes, but also universities worldwide",

This study provides an overview of the scientific literature on seahorses in the 21st century and critically discusses five major knowledge gaps and research opportunities to advance the state of the art on this research field. The average number of publications per year increased from 10 (2001–2002) to ∼40 (2001–2015), the majority addressing issues on seahorse ecology, biology, and aquaculture, with the most studied species being Hippocampus kuda, H. guttulatus, H. reidi, H. abdominalis, H. erectus, H. hippocampus, and H. trimaculatus. This study explores the opportunity of using seahorses as flagship species to foster mangrove conservation and decrease trawling fisheries. It also suggests that further scientific studies are needed to better understand and manage the populations of the most heavily traded seahorse species, as well as the need to monitor their vulnerability to emerging pollutants and climate change. Sustainable seahorse aquaculture can play an important role in seahorse conservation, as well as in the development of reliable traceability tools to fight the illegal trade of these highly priced organismsWe thank the São Paulo Research Foundation–FAPESP (grants nos. 2013/22260-6 and 2015/18050-0) and The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development–CNPq (grant nos. 441356/2014-1) for the financial support provided.

    "abstract": "If marine organisms are to persist through the Anthropocene, they will need to be resilient, but what is resilience, and can resilience of marine organisms build within a single lifetime or over generations? The aim of this review is to evaluate the resilience capacity of marine animals in a time of unprecedented global climate change. Resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem, society, or organism to recover from stress. Marine organisms can build resilience to climate change through phenotypic plasticity or adaptation. Phenotypic plasticity involves phenotypic changes in physiology, morphology, or behaviour which improve the response of an organism in a new environment without altering their genotype. Adaptation is an evolutionary longer process, occurring over many generations and involves the selection of tolerant genotypes which shift the average phenotype within a population towards the fitness peak. Research on resilience of marine organisms has concentrated on responses to specific species and single climate change stressors. It is unknown whether phenotypic plasticity and adaptation of marine organisms including molluscs, echinoderms, polychaetes, crustaceans, corals, and fish will be rapid enough for the pace of climate change",

    "abstract": "Many of the marine resources in the Caribbean are considered to be fully or overexploited. A Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis identified three priority transboundary problems that affect the CLME: unsustainable exploitation of fish and other living resources, the degradation and modification of natural habitats, pollution and contamination. The fourwing flyingfish fishery is the single most important small pelagic fishery in the southern Lesser Antilles. It is a shared resource, which has been traditionally exploited by seven different States, i.e. Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. With expanding fleet capacity and limited cooperation among the States exploiting the flyingfish, there is concern that the resource may become overfished. While the flyingfish fishery is a directed fishery, it is at the same time part of a multi-species, multi-gear fishery, which also targets regional large pelagic species.This case study identifies and analyses the priority transboundary problems and issues. The policy, legal and institutional reforms needed to address such transboundary issues and achieve long-term conservation and sustainable use of the resources are also identified. A major and necessary component of the case study is an evaluation of the existing policy cycles and linkages among the countries and institutions involved with the flyingfish fishery",

    "abstract": "The marine exotic species of the Dutch Caribbean are less well-known than its terrestrial exotics. So far, only 27 known or suspected marine exotic species, some of which are also invasive are documented for one or more islands of the Dutch Caribbean. Four of these were documented only once or were only present for a certain period of time and are no longer present. Six of the species are marine epidemic diseases. As very little is known about these diseases, they might actually be native, but based on the literature and their ecological signature we regard them as special cases of invasive species. In addition to these documented species, 76 other exotic species that have already been observed elsewhere in the Caribbean may already be present or can be expected to arrive in the Dutch Caribbean in the near future. The marine communities of the Dutch Caribbean have suffered major changes based on a handful of marine exotic and/or invasive species, particularly in the special case of (opportunistic) pathogens. In certain cases experience shows that after decades, the affected systems/species may show slow signs of recovery from initial impacts (e.g. the green turtle fibropapillomas), while in other cases the impact may be long-lasting and recovery doubtful (e.g. sea fan mortality). Compared to terrestrial exotic species, eradication and control have been proven difficult or impossible for marine exotics. Therefore, management practices aimed at controlling unwanted species introductions should focus on preventing the arrival of such species by ships-- that transport exotics in their ballast water or as fouling communities on their hulls-- and (accidental) introductions from aquaculture or the aquarium trade. Busy harbors can be expected to be the areas where most marine exotics likely establish first. Because of dispersal of marine exotics is facilitated by ocean currents, local approaches to prevent their arrival or reduce their numbers will be less effective compared to similar efforts for terrestrial species. In the case of marine exotics and invasives, it is paramount that prevention, control and management efforts should be regionally integrated. We conclude this report by listing a number recommendations on how to develop effective management approaches with which to address the impacts and risks associated with marine exotic species.

    "abstract": "In this review we summarize what is known about mechanisms by which climate change may be affecting the populations of seabirds around the UK. Breeding success and adult survival are the key factors affecting changes in seabird populations, and food intake is implicated as a major determinant of both. The diet of most UK seabird species is almost exclusively sandeels, small clupeoid fish or zooplankton and it is clear that the marine pelagic food web is the key ecological system determining food supply. Hence, we develop the review by first considering how climate changes may affect primary production, and then examine how this propagates through the food web to zooplankton and fish culminating in fluctuations in seabird numbers. A trend of increasing numbers of many seabird species since 1970, particularly puffins, guillemots and razorbills, appears to have been reversed since 2000. The proximate cause of the recent declines seems to be a succession of 5 years of low breeding success for a range of species due to a shortage of food, especially sandeels. However, the connection with climate change remains uncertain, though there are indications that declines in the productivity of sandeel populations may be linked in some complex way to warming sea temperatures. The main conclusion is that no part of the marine food web, including fisheries, can be considered in isolation when trying to understand and predict the consequences of climate change for seabirds. Impacts can be expected in all parts of the system, and all parts of the system are interconnected",

Firstly, the fisheries sector provides employment to a substantial portion of the population particularly in the coastal area.  Secondly, it provides 65 percent of animal protein consumed by the people of Sri Lanka.  Thirdly, the fishing industry has proved its capabilities as an earner of foreign exchange through the export of marine product such as prawns, lobsters and other varieties. In 1977 Sri Lanka declared its 200 miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under the new regime for the Law of the Sea.  The government of Sri Lanka formulated and implemented programs with foreign financial and technical assistance to exploit the resources withing the EEZ to increase the supplies of proteins to the citizen and to provide better opportunities for income and employment generation and earning valuable foreign exchange for the country.  The purpose of this paper are to examine present government policies and efforts; examine the current status of fisheries with the EEZ; and make recommendations for future development with the objective of better utilization of the resources within the EEZ",

    "abstract": "The project “Strengthening of the National Hydrographic Office (NHO) of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency of Sri Lanka”, was initiated in the period 1984 - 1986 and commenced in 1988 as a project of Technical Co-operation between the Governments of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit, Federal Ministry of Economic Co-operation, Bonn). Implementing Agencies are the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ - German Agency for Technical Co-operation) and the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency of Sri Lanka (NARA). The objective of the project is to enable the NHO to provide better and more comprehensive hydrographic information to users of these data in Sri Lanka, thus contributing to the overall goal for a better and improved management of aquatic resources of the country's exclusive economic zone. HPC Hamburg Port Consulting GmbH is operating this project by subcontract for the German implementing partner, the GTZ. Since 1988, experts of HPC, with the support of the Fachhochschule Hamburg (Hamburg Polytechnic, Section Hydrography) and the support of the BSH Bundesamt für Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie (Federal Agency for Maritime affairs and Hydrography, Hamburg) were - and still are - engaged in Sri Lanka, together with their respective Sri Lankan partners and counterparts to set up and to strengthen the capability of Sri Lanka's Hydrographic Office. The project originally was planned for three phases, with two years duration each. As the project progressed, it was re-designed and finally modified into three phases of different duration, phase I from 1988-1990 (2 years), phase II from1990-1993 (three years), and the final phase III, from October 1993 to September 1996 (3 years). The National Hydrographic Office of Sri Lanka presently forms an integrated section of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) although one of the targets of the project was to establish the NHO as an independent body for Hydrography. However, it was not possible to establish the NHO as an independent body during the period of operation of this joint project. Reasons for this are complex and are not discussed here. Consequently the NHO continues to function as a section of NARA which constitutes a Research Institute for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development under the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development with limited competence only in the field of Maritime Affairs, Shipping and Hydrography, subjects which are within the competence of the Ministries of Ports and Shipping and Defence (Sri Lanka Navy). At present, phase III of the project is in progress which ends this year (1996)",

The abundance of stranded colonies of those species was assessed using line transects and the specimens were identified taxonomically. Of the porpitids found in this study, V. velella was reported for the first time in Sri Lankan waters while P. porpita was re-reported trustworthy as its initial record was just a sighting. The siphonophore P. physalis was also re-reported and it always represented the lowest abundance among the stranded colonies of the three species. The highest abundance of all the species was from May to August on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, and from November to February on the northeast coast. There was a significant size difference in colonies of each species between the two coasts",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The blue economy emphasizes the sustainable utilization of marine resources to promote economic growth, create job opportunities, and enhance livelihoods while ensuring the protection of the ocean ecosystem. The blue economy comprises a variety of activities such as fisheries, aquaculture and Mari culture, marine and coastal tourism, boat and shipbuilding, seaports and shipping, marine transportation, renewable energy, offshore hydrocarbons and minerals, and marine biotechnology. The primary objective of this research is to identify the opportunities and challenges in expanding the blue economy in Sri Lanka, with a focus on the fisheries sector.\nDesign/methodology/approach: The qualitative research method was employed for data collection, using key person interviews with 20 Sri Lankan blue economy stakeholders. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data.\nFindings: The study identified several opportunities, including the introduction of a sound VMS and forecasting system, technology improvement, properly trained human resources, reducing post-harvest loss, value addition to the fish, and diversification towards aquaculture and Mari culture. The study also identified challenges such as limited access to finance, lack of infrastructure, and weak governance. With the right policies and management practices in place, the fisheries sector in Sri Lanka can achieve sustainable development, contribute to the country's economic growth, and provide livelihoods for fishers and their communities.\nOriginality: Though Sri Lanka is an Island, ideal for practicing the blue economy, the attention given by the scholars and practitioners to develop the sector is not sufficient.&nbsp; This study stands out for its thorough examination of opportunities and challenges in expanding Sri Lanka's blue economy, with a specific emphasis on the fisheries sector.\nImplications: The theoretical contribution lies in the identification of opportunities and challenges in expanding the blue economy, particularly within the fisheries sector. This research significantly contributes to guiding policymakers and stakeholders to develop strategies for the sustainable growth and management of the fisheries sector in Sri Lanka.\nKeywords: Blue Economy, Fisheries, value addition, Post-harvest los",

    "abstract": "People in coastal countries depend on healthy fisheries for their livelihoods. Gross revenue globally from marine fisheries has been estimated during the last decade at $80 billion to $85 billion annually. This estimate, however, reflects only the landed, or market, value of the fish as they first leave the boat, and it underestimates the full economic impact of fisheries. A more accurate accounting of the value of the fishing industry to the global economy would incorporate the indirect effects on related industries that depend on well-managed fisheries",

    "abstract": "The ocean covers nearly three-quarters of the planet and plays an essential role in supporting life on Earth. Its waters help regulate global chemistry and climate, and are home to over 2 million species, many of which still await discovery.1 This rich biodiversity enhances the fisheries that provide food for more than 4 billion people.2 As the human impact on the ocean intensifies, critical ecosystem benefits are being lost. Currents carry millions of tons of plastics and other debris from the shore into open waters, where the waste harms marine life and changes the way healthy ecosystems function.3 Fishing also takes a toll. Worldwide, 4 million open-sea vessels catch more than 80 million metric tons of fish every year,4 which has led to the global decline of marine fisheries. Today, 90 percent of stocks are fully exploited or overexploited.5 New fishing technologies, such as massive steel deep-sea bottom trawls and sonar- and GPS-equipped fish aggregating devices, also degrade important ocean habitats and increase the amount of unintended catch, known as bycatch. The effects of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, such as rising ocean temperatures and increasingly acidic waters, further compound the stress on marine ecosystems. Large, fully protected marine reserves are a key tool for addressing many challenges to ocean health. These reserves protect ocean areas from human activities, such as large-scale fishing, extraction of natural resources, and other destructive uses. And that helps conserve species, habitats, and ecosystem processes. To date, however, about 2 percent of the world's ocean has been designated as fully protected marine reserves. Leading scientists strongly recommend that at least 30 percent be fully protected",

    "abstract": "Declines in marine harvests, wildlife, and habitats have prompted calls at both the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and the 2003 World Parks Congress for the establishment of a global system of marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs that restrict fishing and other human activities conserve habitats and populations and, by exporting biomass, may sustain or increase yields of nearby fisheries. Here we provide an estimate of the costs of a global MPA network, based on a survey of the running costs of 83 MPAs worldwide. Annual running costs per unit area spanned six orders of magnitude, and were higher in MPAs that were smaller, closer to coasts, and in high-cost, developed countries. Models extrapolating these findings suggest that a global MPA network meeting the World Parks Congress target of conserving 20–30% of the world’s seas might cost between $5 billion and $19 billion annually to run and would probably create around one million jobs. Although substantial, gross network costs are less than current government expenditures on harmful subsidies to industrial fisheries. They also ignore potential private gains from improved fisheries and tourism and are dwarfed by likely social gains from increasing the sustainability of fisheries and securing vital ecosystem services",

It covers nearly three-fourths of the globe and is home to nearly a quarter of the world's known species—and many more yet to be discovered.1 The ocean provides sustenance for billions of people and myriad wildlife. But human activities increasingly threaten its health. For example:* About 1 in 5 fish caught in the wild is taken illegally or in unreported fisheries.* 90 percent of the world's fish stocks are fully exploited or overexploited.* Populations of some species of top predator fish have declined by more than 90 percent from historic levels.* Acidification, caused by absorption of carbon dioxide, is changing the chemistry of the ocean, placing sea life at risk. Its waters absorb about a quarter of CO2 emissions created from human activity. The rise in these emissions has increased ocean acidity by about a third since the industrial revolution",

Whole foods and Safeway topped the ranking guide. Four supermarkets -- Roundy's, Bi-Lo, Save Mart and Publix -- failed altogether. Kroger, the fifth biggest food retailer in the world, is exposed for selling the most Red List species of any U.S. grocery chain, for the third consecutive year.\"Consumers want to be able to walk into their local grocery store and know that all the options are sustainable,\" said James Mitchell, Greenpeace Senior Oceans Campaigner. \"That's why Greenpeace is pushing companies like Bi-Lo, Save Mart and Roundy's to drastically improve their sourcing, so that making the right decision is easy for their customers.\"Hy-Vee was evaluated for the first time and immediately entered the top five best performing retailers for sustainable seafood sourcing.Four of the top five supermarkets have, or will shortly launch private label (store brand) sustainable canned tuna products. Consumers will now be able to find sustainable and affordable alternatives to destructively-caught tuna at Whole Foods, Safeway, Trader Joe's, Hy-Vee, and Walmart. The report gives further credit to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's for not stocking Bumblebee, Chicken of the Sea or StarKist's tuna, which are caught using destructive fishing methods.\"When Greenpeace started ranking America's retailers on seafood sustainability in 2008, every company failed. We've seen huge improvements since then, yet grocery giants like Kroger are still stocking too many threatened Red List species, which are often caught using highly destructive fishing methods.\" said Mitchell.Despite progress made by the retail sector overall, overfishing, destructive fishing, and illegal fishing are still major problems for ocean conservation and the economies of developing countries.  Populations of the ocean's top predators like sharks, tuna, and swordfish have dropped by as much as 90% over the past half-century.  Bycatch - where species like sharks and turtles are caught unintentionally in the process of fishing, then thrown back into the sea dead or dying - threatens marine ecosystems as well as global food security.",

VLIZ offers logistic support, promotes expertise internationally, and serves as an interface between the scientific community, governmental bodies, and the public at large. VLIZ wants to give exposure to marine, coastal and estuarine research in Flanders, whereby coordination and dissemination of information play key roles. Marine research in Flanders is carried out by the six Flemish universities, research institutes and departments of the Flemish and federal authorities, and to a lesser extent by private enterprises. The major broad disciplines covered are: biology, earth sciences, chemistry, physics, aquaculture and fisheries, engineering, and maritime affairs. Annually, VLIZ bundles the scientific contributions of the Flemish marine researchers in the ‘VLIZ Collected Reprints’. VLIZ increases the visibility of marine research in Flanders by producing publications, organizing symposia and granting scientific awards. On Friday, 25 February 2005, the fifth ‘VLIZ Young Scientists’ Day’ (161 pre-registered participants) was organized in Provinciehuis Boeverbos, Sint-Andries (Brugge), Belgium.This ‘VLIZ Special Publication 20’ comprises the abstracts of the oral, poster and demo presentations as well as the summaries submitted by the laureates and applicants of the VLIZ aanmoedigingsprijzen mariene wetenschappen 2004’ and ‘Annual VLIZ North Sea Award 2004’",

    "abstract": "Executive Summary Citizen Science is an approach which involves members of the public in gathering scientific data and, in more advanced cases, also involves them in the analysis of such data and in the design of scientific research. Benefits of this approach include enhancing monitoring capabilities, empowering citizens and increasing Ocean Literacy, which can itself lead to the development of environmentally-friendly behaviours. There is a long history of citizen participation in science as a general concept. However, the process of studying and understanding the best ways to develop, implement, and evaluate Citizen Science is just beginning and it has recently been proposed that the study of the process and outcomes of Citizen Science merits acknowledgement as a distinct discipline in its own right. Considering the vastness of the ocean, the extensiveness of the world’s coastlines, and the diversity of habitats, communities and species, a full scientific exploration and understanding of this realm requires intensive research and observation activities over time and space. Citizen Science is a potentially powerful tool for the generation of scientific knowledge to a level that would not be possible for the scientific community alone. Additionally, Citizen Science initiatives should be promoted because of their benefits in creating awareness of the challenges facing the world’s ocean and increasing Ocean Literacy. Responding to this, the European Marine Board convened a Working Group on Citizen Science, whose main aim was to provide new ideas and directions to further the development of Marine Citizen Science, with particular consideration for the European context. This position paper introduces the concept and rationale of Citizen Science, in particular regarding its relationship to marine research. The paper then explores European experiences of Marine Citizen Science, presenting common factors of success for European initiatives as examples of good practice. The types of data amenable to Citizen Science are outlined, along with concerns and measures relating to ensuring the scientific quality of those data. The paper further explores the social aspects of participation in Marine Citizen Science, outlining the societal benefits in terms of impact and education. The current and potential future role of technology in Marine Citizen Science projects is also addressed including, the relationship between citizens and earth observations, and the relevance of progress in the area of unmanned observing systems. The paper finally presents proposals for the improved integration and management of Marine Citizen Science on a European scale. This leads to a detailed discussion on Marine Citizen Science informing Marine Policy, taking into account the requirements of the Aarhus Convention as well as the myriad of EU marine and environmental policies. The paper concludes with the presentation of eight Strategic Action Areas for Marine Citizen Science in Europe (see summary below with details in Chapter 4). These action areas, which are aimed not only at the marine research community, but also at scientists from multiple disciplines (including non-marine), higher education institutions, funding bodies and policy makers, should together enable coherent future Europe-wide application of Marine Citizen Science for the benefit of all.publishedVersio",

    "abstract": "Marine bacteria are the main consumers of the freshly produced organic matter. In order to meet their carbon demand, bacteria release hydrolytic extracellular enzymes that break down large polymers into small usable subunits. Accordingly, rates of enzymatic hydrolysis have a high potential to affect bacterial organic matter recycling and carbon turnover in the ocean. Many of these enzymatic processes were shown to be pH sensitive in previous studies. Due to the continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, seawater pH is presently decreasing at a rate unprecedented during the last 300 million years with so-far unknown consequences for microbial physiology, organic matter cycling and marine biogeochemistry. \n\nWe studied the effects of elevated seawater pCO2 on a natural plankton community during a large-scale mesocosm study in a Norwegian fjord.  Nine 25m-long Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Future Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS) were adjusted to different pCO2 levels ranging from ca. 280 to 3000 µatm by stepwise addition of CO2 saturated seawater. After CO2 addition, samples were taken every second day for 34 days.  The first phytoplankton bloom developed around day 5. On day 14, inorganic nutrients were added to the enclosed, nutrient-poor waters to stimulate a second phytoplankton bloom, which occurred around day 20. \n\nOur results indicate that marine bacteria benefit directly and indirectly from decreasing seawater pH. During both phytoplankton blooms, more transparent exopolymer particles were formed in the high pCO2 mesocosms. The total and cell-specific activities of the protein-degrading enzyme leucine aminopeptidase were elevated under low pH conditions. The combination of enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of organic matter and increased availability of gel particles as substrate supported higher bacterial abundance in the high pCO2 treatments. We conclude that ocean acidification has the potential to stimulate the bacterial community and facilitate the microbial recycling of freshly produced organic matter, thus strengthening the role of the microbial loop in the surface ocean",

    "abstract": "The goal of ecosystem-based marine spatial management is to maintain marine ecosystems in a healthy, productive and resilient condition; hence, they can sustainably provide the needed goods and services for human welfare. However, the increasing pressures upon the marine realm threaten marine ecosystems, especially seabed biotopes, and thus a well-planned approach of managing use of marine space is essential to achieve sustainability. The relative value of seabed biotopes, evaluated on the basis of goods and services, is an important starting point for the spatial management of marine areas. Herein, 56 types of European seabed biotopes and their related goods, services, sensitivity issues, and conservation status were compiled, the latter referring to management and protection tools which currently apply for these biotopes at European or international level. Fishing activities, especially by benthic trawls, and marine pollution are the main threats to European seabed biotopes. Increased seawater turbidity, dredged sediment disposal, coastal constructions, biological invasions, mining, extraction of raw materials, shipping-related activities, tourism, hydrocarbon exploration, and even some practices of scientific research, also exert substantial pressure. Although some first steps have been taken to protect the European sea beds through international agreements and European and national legislation, a finer scale of classification and assessment of marine biotopes is considered crucial in shaping sound priorities and management guidelines towards the effective conservation and sustainability of European marine resources",

The model is based on a bio-economic metapopulation model that can be used to decide which parts of the sea should be opened for fisheries and which should be protected as marine reserve. It accounts for the dispersal of fish and considers both the economic returns from fisheries and the ecological value of marine biodiversity.

Moreover, monitoring also provides context to marine science and over the last century has allowed development of a critical scientific understanding of the marine environment and the impacts that humans are having on it. The seas around the UK are currently monitored by targeted, impact-driven, programmes (e.g., fishery or pollution based monitoring) often using traditional techniques, many of which have not changed significantly since the early 1900s. The advent of a new wave of automated technology, in combination with changing political and economic circumstances, means that there is currently a strong drive to move toward a more refined, efficient, and effective way of monitoring. We describe the policy and scientific rationale for monitoring our seas, alongside a comprehensive description of the types of equipment and methodology currently used and the technologies that are likely to be used in the future. We contextualize the way new technologies and methodologies may impact monitoring and discuss how whole ecosystems models can give an integrated, comprehensive approach to impact assessment. Furthermore, we discuss how an understanding of the value of each data point is crucial to assess the true costs and benefits to society of a marine monitoring programme",

    "abstract": "In the contemporary world, oceans are increasingly realized as ‘threatened places’ in need of environmental protection, at risk from pollution, habitat loss, and overfishing. On the other hand, nations around the world are turning their attention to oceans as a new source of economic development and growth, seeing them as ‘industrialized spaces’. The concept of integrating Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a new approach for sustainable Ocean Governance (SOG). As an effective strategic tool for planning and managing conflicting ocean uses and their interactions with marine ecosystems, the EBM-MSP approach creates an opportunity for long-term development in relation to ocean and its resources. This thesis scrutinizes the contemporary concepts, definitions, and approaches pertinent to the establishment of a comprehensive Ecosystem-based Management and Marine Spatial Planning (EBM-MSP) framework for Sustainable Ocean Governance that reflects global and regional standards. The study also analyses various scientific data – especially the pollutants’ concentration at spatial and temporal scales – with special reference to EBM-MSP. The research analyses international laws, declarations, conventions, and agreements that are relevant to the proposition of a new dynamic approach to SOG based on EBM-MSP. This new approach could be useful to support necessary reforms, filling gaps in legal regimes and achieving integrated and effective ocean governance mechanisms to prevent, reduce, and control pollution in the marine environment, as well as promoting sustainable exploration of marine resources. Specifically, the research critically analyses the existing legal frameworks in relation to SOG in the Bay of Bengal (BOB). Based on an analysis of sectoral legislation and institutional arrangements in the BOB, the thesis recommends the modification and adoption of legislation, as well as integration among the relevant departments of Bangladesh Government, to match transboundary SOG, particularly along with EBM-MSP development processes. The study focuses on national policies and strategies along with sectoral legislation and institutional arrangements to contribute towards EBM-MSP at national level for SOG, by considering socioeconomic balance and jurisdictional overlays. Based on experiences in the Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), the research determines numerous key features to assist with the generation and application of EBM-MSP in the BOB region, specifically in Bangladesh, by integrating EBM-MSP with particular reference to a Comprehensive Ocean Zoning (COZ). The substantial outcome of the study is to suggest a COZ Framework for Bangladesh to protect priority seascapes and sites, species of special concern, and their critical habitats, by designing Marine Protected Area networks throughout the transboundary coast",

    "abstract": "Human population and associated industrial activities continue to increase rapidly, and have reached levels that put the environment under stress in many areas of the world. In addition natural fluctuations of the Earth's physical and biological systems, often occur in time frames that are not readily evident to man. Such fluctuations cause additional stress on the environment, and can result in changes that impact society in terms of diminished availability of clean water, unspoiled land and natural vegetation, minerals, fish stocks, and clean air. Human societies are making a rapidly increasing number of policy and management decisions that attempt to allow both for natural fluctuations and to limit or modify human impact. Such decisions are often ineffective, as a result of economic, political and social constraints, and inadequate understanding of the interactions between human activities and natural responses. Improved understanding of such issues is important in its own right, and will contribute to ameliorating economic, political and social constraints.  Developing improved understanding of environmental change is within the realm of the natural sciences and is being addressed by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and other programmes concerned with describing and understanding the Earth System. Natural variability, occurring over a variety of time scales, dominates the health of complex marine ecosystems, regardless of fishing or other environmental pressure.  We are only now beginning to compile quantitative documentation of such variability, and consequently our knowledge concerning its causes remains at the level of hypotheses. Understanding of the role of variability in the functioning of marine ecosystems is essential if we are to effectively manage global marine living resources such as fisheries during this period of tremendously increased human impact, and concurrent dependence, on these resources",

This Irish Ocean Climate & Ecosystem Status\r\nSummary for Policymakers brings together the\r\nlatest evidence of ocean change in Irish waters.\r\nThe report is intended to summarise the current\r\ntrends in atmospheric patterns, ocean warming,\r\nsea level rise, ocean acidification, plankton and\r\nfish distributions and abundance, and seabird\r\npopulation trends. The report represents a\r\ncollaboration between marine researchers within\r\nthe Marine Institute and others based in Ireland’s\r\nhigher education institutes and public bodies. It\r\nincludes authors from Met Éireann, Maynooth\r\nUniversity, the University of Galway, the Atlantic\r\nTechnological University, National Parks and\r\nWildlife, Birdwatch Ireland, Trinity College Dublin,\r\nUniversity College Dublin, Inland Fisheries Ireland,\r\nThe National Water Forum, the Environmental\r\nProtection Agency, and the Dundalk Institute of\r\nTechnology.This report is intended to summarise the\r\ncurrent trends in Ireland’s ocean climate. Use\r\nhas been made of archived marine data held by\r\na range of organisations to elucidate some of\r\nthe key trends observed in phenomena such as\r\natmospheric changes, ocean warming, sea level\r\nrise, acidification, plankton and fish distributions\r\nand abundance, and seabirds. The report aims to\r\nsummarise the key findings and recommendations\r\nin each of these areas as a guide to climate\r\nadaptation policy and for the public. It builds on the\r\nprevious Ocean Climate & Ecosystem Status Report\r\npublished in 2010.\r\nThe report examines the recently published\r\nliterature in each of the topic areas and combines\r\nthis in many cases with analysis of new data sets\r\nincluding long-term time series to identify trends\r\nin essential ocean variables in Irish waters. In\r\nsome cases, model projections of the likely future\r\nstate of the atmosphere and ocean are presented\r\nunder different climate emission scenarios.Marine Institut",

This is confounded by the small biomass of salmon in a large ecosystem-- a needle in a haystack.\nMaine Sea Grant provided convening and facilitation services to a project sponsored by NOAA Fisheries to bring together marine scientists of multiple disciplines to discuss and develop:\n1) testable hypotheses to advance our understanding of current low marine survival of Atlantic salmon and\n2) management prescriptions to increase marine survival. A series of workshops between 2008-2010, summarized in the final report, captured the most pressing needs for estuarine-marine Atlantic salmon research and management opportunities",
