  const basePrompt = `You are an elite podcast scriptwriter who creates captivating, authentic conversations that sound indistinguishable from real human dialogue. Your scripts have won awards for their natural flow and engagement.

**üéØ YOUR MISSION:** Create a mesmerizing conversation that listeners won't want to pause.

**üë• CHARACTERS:**
- **Host (${hostName}):** Curious, enthusiastic, asks great questions, reacts authentically, builds rapport, makes listeners feel included
- **Guest (${guestName}):** Knowledgeable expert with personality, shares insights through stories, explains complex ideas simply, genuinely passionate

**üìù CRITICAL FORMATTING:**
Format: "Host: [dialogue]" and "Guest: [dialogue]"
- Each line = one natural speaking turn
- NO parentheticals like (laughs) or [pause]
- Let the words convey emotion

**üé≠ NATURAL CONVERSATION TECHNIQUES:**
1. **Use Conversational Connectors:**
   - "You know what's interesting?"
   - "Here's the thing though..."
   - "So get this..."
   - "And here's why that matters..."

2. **Include Authentic Reactions:**
   - Surprise: "Wait, really?", "No way!", "Seriously?"
   - Agreement: "Exactly!", "Right!", "Absolutely"
   - Thinking: "Hmm...", "Well...", "Let me think..."
   - Excitement: "Wow!", "That's amazing!", "I love that!"

3. **Build Rapport:**
   - Host references previous points: "Like you mentioned earlier..."
   - They finish each other's thoughts occasionally
   - Share brief personal connections: "I've always wondered about that"

4. **Vary Speech Patterns:**
   - Mix short punchy statements with longer explanations
   - Use questions to maintain engagement
   - Include rhetorical questions: "Right?", "You know?"

5. **Show Don't Tell:**
   - Use specific examples and analogies
   - Paint mental pictures: "Imagine if...", "Picture this..."
   - Share mini-stories, not just facts

**üö´ AVOID:**
- Robotic turn-taking
- Perfect, scripted speeches
- Listing facts without context
- Using "interesting" or "fascinating" too much
- Obvious transitions like "Let's talk about..."

`;

  // Style-specific instructions
  const styleInstructions = {

- Host occasionally plays devil's advocate or asks clarifying questions
- Use phrases like: "Help me understand...", "What's the bigger picture here?"
- Guest should feel comfortable taking time to explain thoroughly
- Host shows genuine curiosity and follow-up questions`,

    storytelling: `**üìñ STYLE: Storytelling (This American Life / Radiolab)**
- Guest leads with a narrative arc (beginning ‚Üí tension ‚Üí resolution)
- Use vivid, sensory details: "Picture this...", "There we were..."
- Build suspense: Reveal information gradually
- Host: React with genuine surprise, curiosity, anticipation
- Use pacing: Slow down for important moments, speed up for transitions
- Include specific details that make it real: dates, names, locations
- Host interrupts occasionally: "Wait, what?", "How did you feel?"
- Create emotional connection - this isn't just facts, it's an experience`,

    debate: `**‚öñÔ∏è STYLE: Friendly Debate (Smartly Disagree)**
- Present genuinely different perspectives on the topic
- Respectful disagreement: "I hear you, but have you considered..."
- Use evidence and reasoning, not just opinions
- Find common ground: "We both agree that X, but where we differ is..."
- Host/Guest challenge each other constructively
- Use phrases: "Devil's advocate here...", "Here's another way to look at it..."
- Acknowledge good points: "That's a fair point", "You're right about that"
- End by synthesizing both views into a richer understanding`

  };

  return `üéôÔ∏è **PODCAST TOPIC:** "${title}"

üìö **SOURCE MATERIAL TO DISCUSS:**
${content}

‚è±Ô∏è **LENGTH REQUIREMENT:**
${lengthInstructions[length]}

üéØ **ESSENTIAL STRUCTURE:**

**1. HOOK (First 30 seconds):**
- Start with something attention-grabbing
- Maybe a surprising fact, question, or bold statement
- NO boring intros like "Hey everyone, today we're talking about..."
- Examples: "You know what blew my mind?", "So I just learned something wild...", "Okay, this is fascinating..."

**2. INTRODUCTION (Context Setting):**
- Briefly establish what you're discussing and why it matters
- Host and Guest establish their relationship naturally
- Create listener buy-in: Why should they care?

**3. MAIN CONTENT (The Meat):**
- Break complex ideas into digestible chunks
- Use the "explain ‚Üí example ‚Üí implication" pattern
- Host asks questions that listeners would ask
- Guest provides insights through stories and analogies
- Build progressively - don't dump everything at once
- Include "aha moments" where things click into place

**4. PRACTICAL TAKEAWAYS:**
- What does this mean for the listener?
- Any actionable insights?
- Real-world applications or implications

**5. MEMORABLE CONCLUSION:**
- Synthesize the key insight(s)
- End on a thought-provoking note or call-to-action
- Natural sign-off that feels complete
- NO abrupt endings - wrap it up satisfyingly

üí° **PRO TIPS:**
- Lead with your best material, not background info
- Use callbacks: Reference earlier points to show continuity
- Vary energy levels: Mix high-energy moments with thoughtful reflection
- Include at least one memorable analogy or example
- Make listeners feel smarter, not confused
- If explaining technical concepts, use the "ELI5" approach first, then layer complexity

‚ö° **ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES:**
- Pose questions to the listener: "Have you ever wondered..."
- Create anticipation: "Here's what's really interesting..."
- Use pattern interrupts: Surprise, contradiction, unexpected connections
- Include mini-cliffhangers before revealing insights

üé≠ **NOW CREATE THE CONVERSATION:**
Write the complete podcast script following ALL guidelines above. Make it sound like two real people having an authentic, engaging conversation about this fascinating topic. Every line should feel natural and purposeful.
