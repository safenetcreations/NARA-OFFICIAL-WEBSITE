Grade 6 students and their two teachers dived deep into the secrets of mangrove ecosystems through engaging workshops and hands-on field sessions conducted by Ms. Nisanasala Jayasundara, Scientist, NARA.\n\nThe educational program focused on mangrove adaptations, species identification, and the critical role these ecosystems play in coastal protection. Students learned about the unique survival mechanisms that allow mangroves to thrive in saltwater environments and their importance in biodiversity conservation.\n\nThrough interactive sessions, the young learners discovered the various threats facing mangrove ecosystems and the legal frameworks in place to protect them. The program emphasized the importance of environmental stewardship and inspired the next generation to become champions of conservation.",
