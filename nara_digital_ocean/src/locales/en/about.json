      "description": "Since its inception, the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) has stood at the forefront of safeguarding and advancing Sri Lanka's priceless aquatic wealth. As the nation's premier institute for marine and freshwater science, NARA embodies a legacy of innovation, conservation, and sustainable development. From responding to newly expanded maritime boundaries to forging global collaborations today, our journey reflects a commitment to science-driven solutions that uplift ecosystems, communities, and the Blue Economy.\n\nAs we celebrate over four decades of impact, we invite you to explore the milestones that define our enduring mission and the people who make it possible.",

      "title": "Our Founding and Evolution",
      "intro": "NARA was born from a visionary need to harness scientific expertise for Sri Lanka's vast oceanic frontier. In 1981, following the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, Sri Lanka declared a 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)--an expansive 460,000 square kilometers of sea territory, nearly eight times the nation's land area.",
      "body": [
        "To manage this bounty responsibly, NARA was established under Act No. 54 of 1981, transforming the Department of Fisheries Research Division into a dedicated statutory body. Governed by a Board of Governors and empowered to conduct research, advise policymakers, and coordinate national efforts, NARA quickly became the apex authority on aquatic resources spanning oceanography, fisheries enhancement, socio-economic studies, and conservation.",
        "This foundational step marked the dawn of integrated aquatic management in Sri Lanka. Through legislative refinement and global partnerships we have evolved to meet climate realities, biodiversity challenges, and the demands of a thriving Blue Economy--always guided by science, resilience, and service."
