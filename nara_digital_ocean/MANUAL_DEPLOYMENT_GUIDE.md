## üî• Deploy to Firebase (Manual Steps)

### Option 1: Firebase Console Upload (Easiest)

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nara-web-73384/hosting

2. **Click on "Hosting" in left menu**

3. **Click "Add a custom release"** or **"Upload files"**

4. **Upload the entire `build/` folder**
   - Drag and drop the `build` folder
   - Wait for upload to complete (~5-10 minutes)

### Option 2: Command Line (Terminal)

If Firebase login is working in your terminal:

```bash
# In your project directory
cd /Users/nanthan/Desktop/nara\ digital/nara_digital_ocean

# Try logging in via browser
firebase login

# If that works, deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

### Option 3: Use Service Account (Advanced)

```bash
# Set the service account key
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="backend/library-agent/serviceAccountKey.json"

# Deploy using service account
firebase deploy --only hosting --token "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)"
```

## üìç Verify Translations are Accessible (RIGHT NOW)

**Good News:** The translated files are ALREADY uploaded and working!

### Test These URLs in Your Browser:

**Tamil Translation:**
```
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/nara-web-73384.firebasestorage.app/o/pdfs_tamil%2FJournal%2FNARA13440021215-dtic-ada229847-radar-backscatter-from-the-sea-con.txt?alt=media
```

**Sinhala Translation:**
```
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/nara-web-73384.firebasestorage.app/o/pdfs_sinhala%2FJournal%2FNARA13440021215-dtic-ada229847-radar-backscatter-from-the-sea-con.txt?alt=media
```

Just copy and paste these URLs in your browser - they will download the translated text files!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "firebase login" not working

**Solution 1:** Clear Firebase cache
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/firebase
firebase login
```

**Solution 2:** Use browser login URL
```bash
firebase login --no-localhost
# Copy the URL shown and open in browser
# Paste the token back when prompted
```

**Solution 3:** Deploy via Firebase Console (see Option 1 above)

---

## üì± Alternative: Deploy Individual Files

If full deployment doesn't work, you can manually upload just the catalogue:

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Hosting
2. Navigate to `public/` folder
3. Upload `library_catalogue.json` only
4. This updates the catalogue without rebuilding everything

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After deployment, you should see:

1. **Firebase Console:**
   - New release in Hosting history
   - Timestamp shows recent deployment

2. **Website:**
   - Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Visit https://nara-web-73384.web.app/library
   - Check `library_catalogue.json` has new timestamp
   - Look for books with `translations` field

3. **Verification:**
   - Search for book ID 177 or 178
   - Check if they have `translations_available: ["tamil", "sinhala"]`
