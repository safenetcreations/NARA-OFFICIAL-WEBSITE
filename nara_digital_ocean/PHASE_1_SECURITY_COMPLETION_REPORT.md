- ‚úÖ **Security documentation complete** (this report)

**Remaining Items for Full Production Readiness:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Key Rotation Required** (user action needed - see below)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **2 npm vulnerabilities** (non-critical, documented with mitigation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Console.log cleanup** (optional - can be addressed later)

## DETAILED COMPLETION STATUS

### ‚úÖ 1.1 Firestore Security Rules - COMPLETED

**Problem:** 7 collections had `allow write: if true` (anyone could create/modify/delete data)

**Collections Secured:**

| # | Collection Path | Previous Rule | New Rule | Status |
|---|----------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `/divisionImages/{imageId}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 2 | `/researchContent/{contentId}` | `allow create/update/delete: if true` | `allow create/update/delete: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 3 | `/fish_advisories/{advisoryId}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 4 | `/fishing_zones/{zoneId}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 5 | `/fish_market_prices/{priceId}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 6 | `/seasonal_restrictions/{restrictionId}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 7 | `/podcasts/{podcastId}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if isAdmin()` | ‚úÖ Secured |

**Impact:**
- **Before:** Anyone (including malicious actors) could create, modify, or delete data in these collections
- **After:** Only authenticated admin users can write to these collections
- **Deployment:** Rules deployed successfully on October 28, 2025 at 04:13 UTC

**Files Modified:**
- [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) - Lines 53, 328, 609, 617, 625, 633, 645

**Deployment Confirmation:**
```
‚úî firebase.storage: rules file storage.rules compiled successfully
‚úî cloud.firestore: rules file firestore.rules compiled successfully
‚úî storage: released rules storage.rules to firebase.storage
‚úî firestore: released rules firestore.rules to cloud.firestore
‚úî Deploy complete!
```

---

### ‚úÖ 1.2 Firebase Storage Security Rules - COMPLETED

**Problem:** 3 storage paths had `allow write: if true` (anyone could upload files)

**Storage Paths Secured:**

| # | Storage Path | Previous Rule | New Rule | Status |
|---|-------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `/divisions/{divisionId}/{allPaths=**}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if request.auth != null` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 2 | `/podcasts/{allPaths=**}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if request.auth != null` | ‚úÖ Secured |
| 3 | `/research-content/{allPaths=**}` | `allow write: if true` | `allow write: if request.auth != null` | ‚úÖ Secured |

**Impact:**
- **Before:** Anyone could upload files (potential for malware, illegal content, storage abuse)
- **After:** Only authenticated users can upload files
- **Storage Cost Protection:** Prevents malicious actors from uploading unlimited files

**Files Modified:**
- [`storage.rules`](storage.rules) - Lines 39, 45, 134

---

### ‚úÖ 1.3 Environment Variables Protection - COMPLETED

**Problem:** `.env` file with API keys could be accidentally committed to git

**Actions Taken:**
1. ‚úÖ Verified `.gitignore` includes `.env` protection (already present)
2. ‚úÖ Created [`.env.example`](.env.example) template file

**`.env.example` Contents:**
```bash
# NARA Environment Variables Template
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual API keys

# Google Gemini API Configuration
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# OpenAI API Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Mapbox API Configuration
VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here

# Maritime Services API Keys
VITE_STORMGLASS_API_KEY=your_stormglass_key_here
VITE_NASA_EARTHDATA_TOKEN=your_nasa_token_here
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key_here

# NOTE: NEVER commit .env file to git!
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Template created, protection verified

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 1.4 API Key Rotation - USER ACTION REQUIRED

**Problem:** 6 API keys are currently exposed in the `.env` file (which may have been previously committed to git history)

**Current API Keys (Require Rotation):**

| # | Service | Key Type | Action Required |
|---|---------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Google Gemini | `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) |
| 2 | OpenAI | `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate at [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| 3 | Mapbox | `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate at [Mapbox Account](https://account.mapbox.com/) |
| 4 | StormGlass | `VITE_STORMGLASS_API_KEY` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate at [StormGlass Dashboard](https://stormglass.io/) |
| 5 | NASA Earthdata | `VITE_NASA_EARTHDATA_TOKEN` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Refresh at [NASA Earthdata](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) |
| 6 | OpenWeather | `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rotate at [OpenWeather API](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) |

**Rotation Process (Recommended):**

1. **Generate New Keys:**
   - Visit each service's dashboard (links above)
   - Create new API keys
   - Copy new keys to your `.env` file
   - Test that application still works

2. **Revoke Old Keys:**
   - After confirming new keys work
   - Revoke/delete old keys from each dashboard
   - This prevents unauthorized use of exposed keys

3. **Optional: Clean Git History** (Advanced - consult with team first)
```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites git history - coordinate with team!
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (ONLY if coordinating with entire team!)
git push origin --force --all
```

**Timeline:** Recommended within 1 week (before external presentations)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 1.5 Dependency Security - PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**NPM Audit Results:**

```
2 vulnerabilities (1 moderate, 1 high)
```

**Vulnerability 1: vite (Moderate Severity)**
- **Package:** `vite 7.1.0 - 7.1.10`
- **Issue:** `vite allows server.fs.deny bypass via backslash on Windows`
- **Advisory:** [GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7)
- **Fix Available:** ‚úÖ `vite@7.1.12` (requires `npm audit fix --force`)
- **Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - Only affects Windows development servers
- **Mitigation:** Not running on Windows, development-only issue
- **Recommendation:** Update to `vite@7.1.12` before Windows deployment

**Vulnerability 2: xlsx (High Severity)**
- **Package:** `xlsx *` (all versions)
- **Issue 1:** Prototype Pollution - [GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)
- **Issue 2:** ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) - [GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)
- **Fix Available:** ‚ùå No fix available (upstream dependency issue)
- **Risk Assessment:** **MEDIUM** - Only affects Excel file parsing features
- **Mitigation:**
  - Admin-only functionality (not public-facing)
  - Input validation on uploaded files
  - File size limits enforced
- **Recommendation:** Monitor for xlsx package updates, consider alternative library long-term

**Overall Assessment:**
Both vulnerabilities are **non-critical** for current deployment:
- vite: Development-only, macOS environment (not vulnerable)
- xlsx: Admin-only feature, mitigations in place

**Action Required:** Document and monitor (not blocking for Phase 1)

---

### üìù 1.6 Code Cleanup (console.log Statements) - DEFERRED

**Current State:** Approximately 1,364 console.log statements in codebase

**Recommendation:** DEFER to Phase 2 (Presentation Materials preparation)

**Reasoning:**
- Not a security vulnerability (informational only)
- Helps with debugging during development
- Can be batch-removed before production launch
- Automated cleanup script documented in [PRE_PROPOSAL_PREPARATION_GUIDE.md](PRE_PROPOSAL_PREPARATION_GUIDE.md)

**Future Action:**
```bash
# When ready to clean up:
find src/ -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) -exec sed -i '' '/console\.log/d' {} +
```

**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred (not critical for Phase 1)

---
