## 📦 **Firestore Database Structure**

### New Collections Created
1. `research_projects` - Project pipeline tracker data
2. `recruitment_vacancies` - Job vacancy postings
3. `recruitment_applications` - Job applications
4. `recruitment_interviews` - Interview schedules and feedback

### Firestore Security Rules Required
See `firestore.rules` for complete security rules for new collections.

---

## 🔐 **Security Considerations**

### Authentication Required
- Admin panels require authentication
- Firebase Auth integration in place
- Role-based access control recommended

### Data Validation
- All user inputs validated on client and server
- File uploads restricted by type and size
- SQL injection prevention (NoSQL - not applicable)
- XSS prevention through React's automatic escaping

### Firestore Rules
- Read access: Public for public projects, authenticated for internal
- Write access: Authenticated users only
- Admin operations: Require admin role
- Document-level security based on visibility field
