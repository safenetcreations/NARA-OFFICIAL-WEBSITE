  allow read: if resource.data.submission.status == 'approved' 
    && resource.data.visibility == 'public';
  
  // Institutional members can read institutional submissions
  allow read: if request.auth != null 
    && resource.data.submission.status == 'approved'
    && resource.data.visibility == 'institutional';
  
  // Authors can read their own submissions
  allow read: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.authorId;
  
  // Researchers can create submissions
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && isResearcher()
    && request.resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid
    && request.resource.data.submission.status == 'pending';
  
  // Authors can update their pending submissions
  allow update: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.authorId
    && resource.data.submission.status == 'pending'

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: File upload fails

**Causes**:
- File too large (>50MB)
- Network timeout
- Invalid file type
- Storage rules not deployed

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check file size
console.log(file.size / 1024 / 1024, 'MB');

# Deploy storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage

# Check network
- Try smaller file first
- Check browser console for errors
```

### Issue: Form doesn't submit

**Causes**:
- Missing required fields
- Not authenticated
- Not a researcher role
- Firestore rules deny

**Solutions**:
```javascript
// Check authentication
console.log(user, userProfile);

// Check role
console.log(userProfile.role); // Should be 'researcher'

// Test Firestore rules in console
```

### Issue: Success redirect doesn't work

**Causes**:
- Navigation blocked
- Dashboard route not found
- Query params not parsed

**Solutions**:
```javascript
// Check Routes.jsx has dashboard route
<Route path="/library-dashboard" element={<ProtectedRoute>...</ProtectedRoute>} />

// Check useSearchParams in dashboard
const [searchParams] = useSearchParams();
console.log(searchParams.get('submission'));
```
