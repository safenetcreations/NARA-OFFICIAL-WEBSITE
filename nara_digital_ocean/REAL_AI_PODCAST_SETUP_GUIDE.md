# üéôÔ∏è Real AI Podcast Generator - Complete Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What I've Built For You

I've created a REAL AI Podcast Generator system that uses AWS Polly to create NotebookLM-style conversational podcasts.

   - Beautiful admin page to enter all your API keys
   - Supports 6 AI providers (AWS, NotebookLM, ElevenLabs, Google TTS, Azure, OpenAI)
   - Test connection buttons
   - Save to Firebase
   - Enable/disable each provider

2. **`src/services/awsPollyPodcastService.js`** (350+ lines)
   - Real AWS Polly integration
   - NotebookLM-style conversation generator
   - Auto-converts content to dialogue (Host & Guest)
   - Natural pauses and emphasis
   - Uploads to Firebase Storage

## üöÄ Quick Setup (30 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Install AWS SDK**

```bash
cd "/Users/nanthan/Desktop/NARA-NEW-BY:SNC/21-10-25 FINAL NARA MAIN /NARA-OFFICIAL-WEBSITE/nara_digital_ocean"

npm install --legacy-peer-deps @aws-sdk/client-polly
```

---

### **Step 2: Get AWS Credentials**

1. Go to **AWS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com
2. Sign in (or create free account)
3. Go to **IAM** ‚Üí **Users** ‚Üí **Add User**
4. Username: `nara-podcast-generator`
5. Attach policy: **AmazonPollyFullAccess**
6. Click **Security credentials** ‚Üí **Create access key**
7. **COPY BOTH KEYS:**
   - Access Key ID: `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`
   - Secret Access Key: `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

---

### **Step 3: Add API Configuration Page to Admin**

Update your admin routes to include the new AI API Configuration page:

**File:** `src/Routes.jsx` or admin routes

```javascript
// Add this import
import AIAPIConfiguration from './pages/admin/AIAPIConfiguration';

// Add this route
<Route path="/admin/ai-api-config" element={<AIAPIConfiguration />} />
```

---

### **Step 4: Enter Your API Keys**

1. Go to: `http://localhost:4028/admin/ai-api-config`
2. Find **AWS Polly** section
3. Click **Enable** button
4. Enter your AWS credentials:
   - Access Key ID: (paste from Step 2)
   - Secret Access Key: (paste from Step 2)
   - Region: `us-east-1` (or your preferred region)
5. Click **Test Connection**
6. Click **Save All**

---

### **Step 5: Update EnhancedAIPodcastGenerator**

Replace the fake `handleGenerate` function with real AWS Polly integration:

**File:** `src/pages/podcasts/EnhancedAIPodcastGenerator.jsx`

Add import at top:
```javascript
import { generateNotebookLMPodcast } from '../../services/awsPollyPodcastService';
```

Replace lines 200-212 with:
```javascript
const handleGenerate = async () => {
  if (!aiGeneratedScript) {
    alert('Please enhance the script first!');
    return;
  }

  try {
    setGenerationStep('processing');
    setProgress(0);

    // REAL AI GENERATION
    const result = await generateNotebookLMPodcast(
      {
        title: title,
        description: content,
        script: aiGeneratedScript,
        category: podcastSettings.language === 'en' ? 'marine-research' : 'international',
        tags: [],
        settings: podcastSettings
      },
      // Progress callback
      (progressData) => {
        setGenerationStep(progressData.stage);
        setProgress(progressData.progress);
      }
    );

    setGenerationStep('complete');

    // Notify parent
    if (onGenerate) {
      onGenerate(result);
    }

    alert(`‚úÖ Podcast Created Successfully!

Podcast ID: ${result.podcastId}
Audio URL: ${result.audioUrl}
Duration: ${result.duration} seconds
Segments: ${result.segments} conversation turns

The podcast is now live in your podcasts list!`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Generation failed:', error);
    setGenerationStep(null);
    setProgress(0);

    alert(`‚ùå Failed to generate podcast:

${error.message}

Please check:
1. AWS Polly is configured in Admin ‚Üí AI API Config
2. AWS credentials are correct
3. You have internet connection
4. AWS Polly service is not down`);
  }
};
```

     Guest: Thanks for having me! I'm excited to discuss this.
     Host: Let's start with the basics...
     Guest: That's fascinating. [content continues]
     ```

4. **AWS Polly generates audio**
