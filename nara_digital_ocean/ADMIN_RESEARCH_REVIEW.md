## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Access Denied" for admin user

**Cause**: User role not set in Firestore

**Solution**:

// In Firestore libraryUsers collection
{
  uid: "admin-uid",
  role: "admin",  // or "librarian"
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Issue: Submissions not loading

**Causes**:
- Firestore security rules deny read
- No submissions exist
- Query error

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check Firestore rules allow admin read
allow read: if isAdmin();

# Check browser console for errors
# Verify submissions exist in Firestore
```

### Issue: Review not saving

**Causes**:
- Firestore security rules deny write
- Missing required fields
- Network error

**Solutions**:
```javascript
// Ensure admin write permission in rules
allow write: if isAdmin();

// Check status is selected
console.log(reviewData.status); // Must not be empty

// Check network tab for failed requests
```

### Issue: Status filter not working
