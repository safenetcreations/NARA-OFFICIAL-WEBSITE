## 📖 Integration Guide

### Step 1: Import Services

Add to `ResearchEnhancedMSP.jsx`:

```javascript
// At the top of the file
import mspCloudService from '../../services/mspCloudService';
import { generatePDFReport } from '../../services/mspPDFReportService';
import { importFile } from '../../services/mspImportService';
import { useAuth } from '../../contexts/AuthContext';
```

### Step 2: Add Cloud Save Function

```javascript
const { currentUser } = useAuth();

const saveToCloud = async () => {
  if (!currentUser) {
    alert('Please sign in to save to cloud');
    return;
  }

  const result = await mspCloudService.saveProjectToCloud(
    currentUser.email,
    currentProject
  );

  if (result.success) {
    alert('✅ Project saved to cloud!');
    setCurrentProject(prev => ({ ...prev, isCloudSynced: true }));
  } else {
    alert(`❌ Error: ${result.error}`);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Add Import Function

```javascript
const handleImport = async (file) => {
  const result = await importFile(file);

  if (result.success) {
    setDrawnShapes([...drawnShapes, ...result.shapes]);
    alert(`✅ Imported ${result.shapes.length} zones`);
  } else {
    alert(`❌ Import failed: ${result.error}`);
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Add PDF Export Function

```javascript
const exportPDF = async () => {
  const mapElement = document.querySelector('.leaflet-container');

  const result = await generatePDFReport(
    currentProject,
    mapElement,
    {
      logoUrl: '/images/nara-logo.png',
      includePhotos: true,
      includeMap: true
    }
  );

  if (result.success) {
    alert(`✅ PDF generated: ${result.filename}`);
  } else {
    alert(`❌ Error: ${result.error}`);
  }
};
```

### Step 5: Add UI Buttons

```jsx
{/* In the top navigation bar */}
<button onClick={saveToCloud} className="...">
  <Cloud className="w-4 h-4" />
  Save to Cloud
</button>

<button onClick={() => fileInputRef.current.click()} className="...">
  <Upload className="w-4 h-4" />
  Import
</button>

<button onClick={exportPDF} className="...">
  <FileText className="w-4 h-4" />
  PDF Report
</button>

{/* Hidden file input */}
<input
  type="file"
  ref={fileInputRef}
  accept=".geojson,.json,.kml,.csv"
  style={{ display: 'none' }}
  onChange={(e) => handleImport(e.target.files[0])}
/>
```
