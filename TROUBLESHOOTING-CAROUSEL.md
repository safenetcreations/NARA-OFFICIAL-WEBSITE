# 🔧 Troubleshooting Image Carousel

## ❓ Issue: Images Not Showing in Hero Section

Let me help you debug this!

---

## 🔍 Quick Checks:

### 1. **Open Browser Console**
- Press `F12` to open DevTools
- Click "Console" tab
- Visit: http://localhost:4028/divisions/environmental-studies-division
- Look for these messages:

**What you should see:**
```
✅ Loaded images from Firebase: 4
OR
📸 Using default hero images: 4
```

**If you see errors:**
- Copy the error message
- Let me know what it says

---

### 2. **Check the Hero Section**

When you visit the division page, look at the top hero section:

**What you should see:**
- Large image background
- Division name and tagline overlay
- **Small white dots** at the bottom (navigation)
- Image should change every 5 seconds

**If you see:**
- Just solid color gradient → Images not loading
- No dots → Carousel not initialized
- Blank section → Data not loaded

---

### 3. **Verify Page Loaded**

Check if the page shows:
- ✅ Division name in header
- ✅ Navigation tabs (Overview, Focus Areas, etc.)
- ✅ Content sections
- ✅ Footer

**If not showing:**
- Server might not be running
- JavaScript error preventing render

---

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Hard Refresh
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Or: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### Fix 2: Clear Cache
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### Fix 3: Check Server
Look at your terminal where npm run start is running.

**Should see:**
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:4028/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

**If not running:**
```bash
cd nara_digital_ocean
npm run start
```

## 🐛 Common Issues:

### Issue A: "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
**Cause:** heroImages array not initialized
**Fix:** Already handled with fallback images

### Issue B: Images show but don't rotate
**Cause:** useEffect for rotation not running
**Check:** Console for any errors

### Issue C: Only 1 image shows
**Cause:** Using old config without carousel
**Fix:** Already updated the code

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior:

### When Page Loads:
1. Loads division data from config ✅
2. Tries to fetch images from Firebase
3. Falls back to default 4 images
4. Sets up auto-rotation
5. Displays first image
6. Shows navigation dots
7. Starts 5-second rotation timer

### Every 5 Seconds:
1. Current image fades out (zoom out)
2. Next image fades in (zoom in)
3. Dot indicator moves
4. Smooth transition (1.5s)
5. Repeats infinitely

---

## 🧪 Debug Steps:

### Step 1: Check Console
```javascript
// You should see one of these:
✅ Loaded images from Firebase: 4
📸 Using default hero images: 4
```

### Step 2: Inspect Hero Section
```javascript
// Right-click hero section → Inspect
// Look for div with backgroundImage style
// Should see: url(https://images.unsplash.com/...)
```

### Step 3: Check State
```javascript
// In console, type:
React.version  // Should show React version
```

---

## 🎯 What Should Be Working:

After my fixes:
- ✅ divisionHeroImages.js created (4 images per division)
- ✅ getDivisionHeroImages() function ready
- ✅ Division page imports the function
- ✅ Fallback logic implemented
- ✅ Auto-rotation useEffect added
- ✅ Navigation dots displayed
- ✅ AnimatePresence wraps carousel

---

## 💡 Next Steps:

### If Still Not Working:

**Tell me:**
1. What do you see in the console? (any errors?)
2. Does the hero section show any image at all?
3. Do you see navigation dots?
4. Is the server running without errors?

I'll fix it immediately!

### If It's Working:

**You should see:**
- Beautiful rotating images in hero ✨
- 4 dots at bottom for navigation
- Smooth transitions every 5 seconds
- Professional photography

**Test all 10 divisions - each has unique images!**

**Let me know what you see and I'll help debug!** 🔧✨
