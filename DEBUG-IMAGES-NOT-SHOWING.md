# 🔍 Debug: Images Not Showing in Hero

## Let's Check Step by Step:

### **Step 1: Verify Images Were Saved**

Open browser console (F12) and type:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('nara_division_images'))
```

**Press Enter**

**What do you see?**

**Option A:** Shows object like:
```javascript
{
  "environmental-studies": {
    "images": ["https://image.pollinations.ai/...", ...],
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-23..."
  }
}
```
→ **GOOD!** Images ARE saved ✅

**Option B:** Shows `null`
→ Images NOT saved ❌ - Generate them again

---

### **Step 2: Check Division ID Match**

In console on the division page, look for:
```
🔍 Checking localStorage for division: ???
```

**What division ID does it show?**

Should be: `environmental-studies`

**If it shows something else** (like `post-harvest`), that's the wrong page!

---

### **Step 3: Hard Refresh the Page**

**Press:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

This forces a complete reload including JavaScript.

**Then check console again.**

---

### **Step 4: Clear and Regenerate**

If still not working:

**In Console, type:**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('nara_division_images')
```

**Then:**
1. Go back to admin panel
2. Select Environmental Studies
3. Click "Generate AI Images"
4. Wait for 4 images to appear
5. Click green "View in Hero Section" button
6. Check if images show

---

## 🎯 Expected Console Messages:

**You should see:**
```
🔍 Checking localStorage for division: environmental-studies
💾 SUCCESS! Loaded 4 images from localStorage
🎉 AI IMAGES CONNECTED TO HERO SECTION!
```

**If you see:**
```
📸 Using default hero images: 4
```

→ localStorage not found or division ID mismatch

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps:

### **Complete Reset:**

**1. In browser console:**
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```

**2. Close all tabs with division pages**

**3. Go to admin:**
```
http://localhost:4028/admin/division-images
```

**4. Select Environmental Studies**

**5. Generate images**

**6. When success message appears, click "View in Hero Section"**

**7. In the NEW tab that opens, check console**

---
